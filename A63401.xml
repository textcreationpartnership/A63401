            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A TRUE and IMPARTIAL HISTORY OF THE <hi>Kingdom of</hi> Ireland, DESCRIBING Its Situation, Ancient Inhabitants, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Customs, and the State it was found in at the Time it was Invaded and Conquered by the <hi>English,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> II. &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> is of no mean Extent, but rather very large and considerable; It is an Island, it is bounded on the <hi>East</hi> with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> on the <hi>West</hi> with the main Ocean, on the <hi>South</hi> with part of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> and on the <hi>North</hi> with the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calidonian</hi> Sea. It is, as all other Islands, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Water, containing in Length 400, and in Breadth 200 Miles, and is espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37916:7"/> parted or divided into four Provinces, <hi>viz. Munster,</hi> which is again divided into the Counties of <hi>Limerick, Kerrey, Waterford, Cork, Desmon,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Cross</hi> in <hi>Tipperary.</hi> 2. The Province of <hi>Leinster,</hi> divided into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Meaths, Kilkenney, Caterlough, King's County, Kildare, Wexford, Dublin</hi> and <hi>Wicklow.</hi> 3. The Province of <hi>Connought,</hi> divided into the Counties of <hi>Clare, Thumond, Majo, Sligo, Letarim,</hi> and <hi>Roscomon.</hi> 4. The Province of <hi>Ʋlster,</hi> divided into the Counties of <hi>Tyrconnel, Tyrone, Cavan, Coleraine, Monaghan, Antrim, Down, Armah,</hi> and <hi>Lough;</hi> and these are for the most part at this day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished with many considerable Cities and Towns, of which I shall have occasion to speak in the Series of this History, as they shall fall in their proper places. The Country is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very fruitful, and seems by the Soil al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to have been so, though the Natives have not appear'd very active in improving it, as being naturally given up to sloath, or to live by War and Rapine. As for the first Peopling it after <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, it remains ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much, if not altogether in the dark, the Natives having been imposed on by Monks and Bards, a sort of Rimers and Fortune-Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, with Fables for Reality, though it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured by the Learned, that this Island was Peopled upon the Confusion of Tongues at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> soon after the Flood; and the <hi>Irish</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of the best account, tell us, That one <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolenus,</hi> encouraged by the Example of <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> settled his Monarchy in the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37916:7"/> Islands, and amongst others peopled this; yet where he kept his head Residence no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made, but that his three Sons ruling there, had War with Giants that grew up in the Land and rebelled against them; and that afterward divers <hi>Scythians</hi> roving to seek Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, got footing there; and so they go on in the doubtful Paths of Uncertainty a great way farther: But true it is, that according to our own Histories, and those of other Nations, the <hi>Irish</hi> began very early to rove abroad, and in their Boats, and such kind of Ships as they had, coming frequently ashore in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and other Places, did great Mischief by Burning and Plundering, but were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly met withal, and a great many of them kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Nor do we find that the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they conquered <hi>Britain,</hi> extended their Arms to <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is held they were Converted to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion by St. <hi>James</hi> the Apostle; and some give large grounds for it: but their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors will have it done by one <hi>Paladinus,</hi> sent thither to that purpose by Pope <hi>Celestine,</hi> but more especially perfected by St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> to whom they ascribe a thousand Incredibilities: But to leave these Conjectures that are not greatly pertinent to our Matter, we now come nearer to that for which we have more War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and Certainty.</p>
            <p>The first Acquaintance that the <hi>English</hi> had with the <hi>Irish,</hi> as to any thing that is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, was in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second of <hi>England,</hi> their chief Communication being with

               <hi>France,</hi> whether they sent several Bands of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to help them against the <hi>English,</hi> who were Waring there under their King for the Recovery of his Right in the Provinces that were his Grand-father's, which he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pretty well settled, turned his Thoughts upon <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he heard they were at Variance among themselves, the whole Land being divided under many Petty Princes, when it luckily happened a business fell out that gave him an easie Inlet to the Conquest of it; for in the Year 1167. the Eastern Part of the Island along the Sea being possessed by <hi>Dormat Mac-mur,</hi> King of <hi>Leinster,</hi> his Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had highly incensed his Subjects against him, and what more raised their Fury, was, the Injury he did to <hi>Morice</hi> King of <hi>Meath,</hi> by wheedling away his Queen, and living with her in Adultery; so that the inraged Husband seeking Reparation and Revenge, invaded his Countries, by the Assistance of <hi>Roderick O Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> King of <hi>Connaught,</hi> at the Terror of whose Approach, <hi>Dormat</hi> being detested by, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of his Subjects, was forced to flie to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and there implored Protection; which upon taking an Oath of Fidelity and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the King, was freely given him; and <hi>Henry,</hi> with a Sum of Money, procured leave of Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> an <hi>English</hi>-man, promoted to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, that he might Conquer <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> promising moreover, throughly to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the Christian Religion, and bring it to an Acknowledgment of the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> but whilst he was preparing to pass the Seas; new
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37916:8"/> Troubles arose in his <hi>French</hi> Territories, that required his Presence; yet by his Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents he gave Leave, with Encouragement to his Nobles, and such others as were willing to go for <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dormat</hi> impatient of his Exile, mainly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Concession, solicited <hi>Richard</hi> the King's Son, promising not only his Daughter, a very beautiful young Lady in Marriage, but great Possessions in the Country, when he should be restored, and all his Territories after his Death. The young Prince being of a Warlike Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and thirsting after Glory, resolved, though his Father was absent, to undertake this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and early the next Spring sailed from <hi>Bristol</hi> with divers Ships, on Board which were thirty Knights, sixty Esquires, and three hundred Archers, the first <hi>English-men</hi> ever known to land in a Hostile-manner in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and being met by <hi>Dormat</hi> with such Forces as he, going over a little before, had raised, they seized upon the Town of <hi>Wexford,</hi> which was given to one <hi>Fitz-Stevens,</hi> a <hi>Welch</hi> Gentleman, according to Agreement upon his raising part of the Forces; so that News of this, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Successes flying to <hi>England,</hi> many Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers came over; and although the Petty Kings joyned their Forces, yet were they beat in divers bloody Battels: and <hi>Dormat</hi> being restored, had <hi>Dublin</hi> submitted to him, inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grievous Punishments upon such of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Enemies as he found there.</p>
            <p>The Prince being now in <hi>Ireland,</hi> greatly increasing in Strength, that came over to him,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37916:9"/> carried all before him; which made King <hi>Henry,</hi> who feared the Prince's aspiring upon such Successes, and willing to have the honour of Conquering so large a Kingdom himself, sent his Mandate to recall the <hi>English</hi> out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> so that but a few being left with the Prince in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and they reduced to a great streight by the <hi>Irish</hi> that had taken heart, they nevertheless Sallied upon an Army of 30000 with not above 1500 Men, and utterly routed them, taking great Spoil; and then coming for <hi>England,</hi> he surrendered all the Cities and Forts he had taken into his Father's Hands, for <hi>Dormat</hi> by this time was dead; and in the Year 1172. King <hi>Henry</hi> landed with a Royal Army, which brought such a Terrour upon <hi>Ireland,</hi> that <hi>Roderick,</hi> and most of the Petty Princes that were Independent, or his Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, came with their humble Supplications to intreat him, <hi>That he would take the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him, as their Supream Prince and Lord:</hi> So that at <hi>Christmas</hi> he made them a Noble Feast in <hi>Dublin;</hi> and settled the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Civil and Ecclesiastical Matters, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Abuses and Barbarities: And soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter those that held out in <hi>Ʋlster</hi> were brought to submit, from which time we may Date the Conquest of <hi>Ireland</hi> by the <hi>English,</hi> under which Soveraignty it has ever since remained as a conquered Kingdom, and now annexed to the Crown: yet the Natives who are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hot spirited, uneasie, and restless under Restraint, have often strugled to break this Chain, though to the Loss and Disadvantage mostly of themselves.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:37916:9"/>
            <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> the First, by reason of his Wars in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> his Imprisonment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Return in <hi>Austria</hi> and the Empire, and other Disappointments he met with at home, had no War with the <hi>Irish,</hi> nor happened there any thing extraordinary, but care and industry to settle the Government; which was done with such tenderness, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives being more civilized, began to think themselves happy in the change, and that they were redeemed from perpetual War, which when so many Princes governed as Absolute in their Dominions, could not be avoided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong so rough and stubborn a People. But because King <hi>Edward</hi> the First had sent for Forces out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to help him against the <hi>Scots,</hi> with whom he had mortal Wars, the wilder sort of the <hi>Irish</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> the Second's time invited them over, and many of the leading Men of the Natives revolting, ruining the Country; but upon the <hi>English</hi> joyning Battel with them they were routed, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 11000 slain, among whom was a King of <hi>Connought,</hi> and one <hi>Okly</hi> a Lord of great Possessions: but soon after the Lord <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> being sent over as Lord Justice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he managed Matters so ill, that the <hi>Scots</hi> were again called in under <hi>Edward Bruce,</hi> Brother to the <hi>Scots</hi> King, who taking several places by the Revolt of the <hi>Irish</hi> from the <hi>English</hi> Obedience, caused himself to be Crowned King of <hi>Ireland;</hi> But in a great Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel his Forces being routed, and he labouring to restrain their flight, was killed by one <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:37916:10"/> whom he likewise requited with Death before his Fall, and the dead Bodies fell by that means on each other, which happened in the Year 1320.</p>
            <p>However, they were rather dispersed than broken, doing considerable Mischief where they found an opportunity to fall upon the <hi>English,</hi> that had settled themselves in the Towns and Villages near the Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1329. during the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, the <hi>Irish</hi> in <hi>Leinster</hi> and <hi>Meath</hi> rebelled; against whom the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> drew out what Forces he could, but being over-poured in number, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, and the <hi>Irish</hi> made great Spoils of the <hi>English</hi> Possessions, and amongst other Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, burnt eighty of them in a Church where they had fled for Refuge; but at last the <hi>English</hi> fortified themselves in <hi>Wexford,</hi> and upon their approach to besiege it, sallied out upon them with such Courage, that Success crowned it, and 4000 of the <hi>Irish</hi> were killed, most of them that fled being hotly pursued, were drowned in the River <hi>Slane;</hi> which with some other Encounters, where Victory decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on our side, so quelled them, that in this King's Reign they rebelled no more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1398. in the Reign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, the <hi>Irish</hi> fell again into Rebellion, and by Surprize fall upon the King's Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and divers Persons of Quality, whom they slew; which made the King with consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Forces haste thither, and Landing, he put them in all parts to the Rout, killing a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37916:10"/> great many, and taking several of their Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders; and keeping his Court of State at <hi>Dublin,</hi> to him resorted the Nobility and chief of the <hi>Irish,</hi> submitting and paying him Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, promising to keep the Country in quiet for the future: but Troubles arising in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the King hastily left <hi>Ireland,</hi> and was no sooner arrived in <hi>Wales,</hi> but finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self deserted, he betook him to a Castle, where he was seized by <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> to whom he resign'd his Crown, and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inhumanly murthered. Upon whose Death many Troubles and Contentions arose; so that the <hi>English</hi> being embroyled at home, <hi>Ireland</hi> was little minded, the People there doing, in a manner, what they pleased. But in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, we being setled at home, more care was taken to prevent the Outrages and Depradations of the <hi>Irish;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, that several who had been formerly Offenders were punished, and others fled, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom were divers of their great Ones, who notwithstanding the care of the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> then Lieutenant of the Kingdom, to repress them, drew a great multitude of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into Rebellion: but the Earl gave Battel at <hi>Redmore-Athy,</hi> where the <hi>Irish</hi> under the Leading of <hi>O Moor,</hi> stood stoutly to it as Men in despair; but after a bloody Fight, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured all the Ditches of the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37916:11"/> that nothing memorably occurs in History, till the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, when the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> being Deputy, one <hi>Richard Symons</hi> a Priest, wheedled him into a belief, that one <hi>Lambert</hi> a Youth, whom he had brought up as his Scholar, was really the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> Son to <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> Brother to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, that had escaped out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and was come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for protection; and the young Spark ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been well tutored, and of a graceful Carriage, so well acted his part, that not only the Lieutenant, but a great many of the <hi>Irish</hi> Nobility sided with him, raising considerable Forces to espouse his Quarrel, Crowning him King in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and not content to keep him there, they brought him with a considerable Army into <hi>England,</hi> landing in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and Proclaiming him. But the King's Forces advancing, they were in a Set-battel over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and the Imposter taken Prisoner, the Priest hanged, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They likewise in the King's Reign aided another called <hi>Perkin,</hi> or <hi>Peter Warbeck,</hi> who stiled himself Duke of <hi>York,</hi> younger Son to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth; but in this they had no better success than in the former, a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being killed, the Impostor taken, after se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Attempts, and bloody Encounters, having engaged the <hi>Scots</hi> as well as <hi>Irish,</hi> on his part, marrying the Lady <hi>Catharine Gourdon,</hi> Niece to that King; he was first obliged to confess his Impostor, how he was set on, maintained and encouraged by the Dutchess of <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:37916:11"/> Sister to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and then being publickly punished, was sent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> from whence endeavouring to escape, he was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and with him the real Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who had been kept a Prisoner there a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time: all that was alledged against him was, that he attempted to make his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape with <hi>Perkin,</hi> to raise new Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, great Commotions were stirred up, which were at first suddenly appeased, but the Earl of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare</hi> being Deputy, the People exhibited their Complaints against him to the Court of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as the cause of many Disturbances by his severe using them, and amongst other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles they had this, <hi>viz.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37916:12"/> their crossing the Seas, demanded of the Master, what the Name of the Ship was? who replied, The <hi>Cow: Nay then,</hi> said he, looking on the rest with a dejected Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>we are all lost Men; for now a Prophecy comes into my head, that says, Five Brethren of an Earl should be carried into</hi> England <hi>in the Belly of a Cow, and never come back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: and I doubt not, but all things hitting so pat, we are they.</hi> And indeed so it happen'd; for being Accused of the late Rebellion, though two of them were ignorant of it; the Lord <hi>Thomas,</hi> Son to the Earl, was beheaded on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> and the five Brethren hang'd drawn, and quartered at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> and the Earl soon after died in the <hi>Tower</hi> of Grief, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the Center of that Noble Family; for although one Brother escaped, yet travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling through many Countries, he at last came to <hi>Naples,</hi> and there died Childless. Nor did the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> escape, for being countermand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and accused of holding Correspondency with this Family, though without any notable Proof, he was Condemned for High-Treason, and beheaded on <hi>Tower-hill.</hi>

            <p>The Kings of <hi>England,</hi> the better to please the Natives of <hi>Ireland,</hi> having been all this while only called <hi>Lords of</hi> Ireland, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament sitting at <hi>Westminster</hi> in the 33d year of <hi>Henry</hi>'s Reign, invested with the Title of <hi>King of</hi> Ireland: whereupon the Earl of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone,</hi> and divers others rebelled; but in some bloody Encounters being defeated, the Earl was at last subdu'd, and brought Prisoner for

               <hi>England;</hi> yet upon his humble Submission re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased and sent over, upon promise of keeping the Country in quiet; which he pretty well observed during the short Reigns of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> only some petty Commotions happened that were soon quieted.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1566. being the Seventh year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, one of the chief Lords of <hi>Ireland,</hi> named <hi>Donald Mac Carti More,</hi> upon some little stirs that happened, came over, and not only cleared himself to the Queen, but delivered up to her all his Territories, vowing perpetual Fealty; but she in gratitude restored them again, and made him Earl of <hi>Glencare,</hi> giving him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Sum to bear his Expences; so that by his great Authority amongst the Natives, it was thought the Kingdom would be kept quiet; but it proved otherwise: for after some private Conspiracies, that never broke out, were defeated, the Earl of <hi>Desmond,</hi> the Eleventh Earl of that Title, who had great Territories and abundance of Followers, broke into open Rebellion, and did great damage to the <hi>English,</hi> driving them out of many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, killing divers Gentlemen in Revenge, as he said, of the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> and his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being put to death; and amongst others, one with whom he had contracted a strict Friendship, and usually called Father, who when he saw him with his drawn Sword breaking into his Chamber, and relying upon his former Friendship, cried out, <hi>What is the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37916:13"/> matter,</hi> Desmon, <hi>my Son?</hi> to whom the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Earl sternly replied, <hi>I am no longer thy Son, nor thou my Father; but thou shalt surely die:</hi> and thereupon they put him, and all they found in the House to the Sword.</p>
            <p>These Outrages allarmed the Lord Deputy, who drawing out his Forces after divers Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes put the Earl to the Rout, who being forsaken of his Followers, lurked for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in the Bogs and Mountains; but misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble want driving him thence among the Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, he was there found and slain by a private Souldier, when his Head being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to <hi>England,</hi> was set upon <hi>London-Bridge;</hi> and so fell this Eleventh Earl of <hi>Desmond.</hi> But in his Grave the restless Spirits of the <hi>Irish</hi> were not buried, for casting their Eyes on the Family of the <hi>Bourks,</hi> they gave out they would have an eminent Person of that Family to be their King, or Governour; and many Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults were raised: but this prudent Queen, notwithstanding some intestine Troubles at home, took such care, that she a long time by Policy and Force reduced the unruly Natives to their Obedience; the former of which was particularly effected by driving away their Cattel, and making them submit through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream necessity, after they had been got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Woods, about forty Days. The Second was by the timely Notice the Deputy had of Two thousand <hi>Scotch Highlanders</hi> land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to joyn with the <hi>Irish,</hi> and knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that they had laid down their Arms, as to their greatest number, they came on with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37916:14"/> such as fell in with them by the way, in hopes to joyn the rest, breaking into the Province of <hi>Connaught,</hi> where indeed a great many of the Country Peasants took Arms on their part; but the Lord-Deputy by speedy Marches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and finding they were got into Bogs and Fastnesses, after he had encamped within sight a-while, feigned a Retreat, and they, by reason of their over-numbring him, supposing he had fled, immediately followed; but were no sooner trained on the firm ground, e're the <hi>English</hi> fac'd about, charged their Front and Flanks, piercing the Array of their Battel, and put them to utter rout and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, so that not above eighteen of them esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, of upwards of Three thousand, which crushed the <hi>Scots</hi> attempting to help them in their Rebellion.</p>
            <p>These bad Successes shewing plainly, the Hand of Heaven against them, did not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever make them sensible of their Misfortune, in taking up Arms against a powerful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for perceiving themselves too weak to struggle in the Lyons Paws, they began to tamper with other Nations, alledging after the Reformation, <hi>Religion,</hi> as a ground to justifie their Rebellions, though they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver starting from their Allegiance, when both Nations professed that of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion; but now taking this for a plausible pretext, the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> began under hand to deal with <hi>Philip</hi> the Second of <hi>Spain,</hi> for Succours of Men and Ammunition, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to hold the Kingdom at his Devotion:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37916:14"/> but this being about to be discovered by <hi>Hugh O Neale, Tyrone</hi> in a rage clapped a Cord about his Neck, and strangled him with his own hands. Notwithstanding this, it was known, and he summoned to answer it in the <hi>English</hi> Court; and upon some assurance of Pardon he went, submitting himself, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king such plausible Protestations of Innocency, that times running high by reason that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were about to Invade <hi>England,</hi> he was pardoned, and sent over again, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward proved Ingrateful, and a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Enemy.</p>
            <p>Much about this time one <hi>Mac Malcoon,</hi> a leading Man among the <hi>Irish,</hi> stirred up Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions about paying Taxes, for which he was taken, tried, and executed, his Estate being given partly to his Family, and partly to the <hi>English,</hi> that living upon it they might curb and over-awe the rest: Whereupon one <hi>Brian O Roch,</hi> who had sided with him, to prevent a present Punishment, fell into an open Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; but upon the Rout that immediately was given him, he fled into <hi>Scotland</hi> for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; but the Queen's Influence was so great upon that Kingdom, that she had him deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up; and being tried at <hi>Westminster,</hi> he was there found Guilty, and being carried to <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> he was there executed without being concerned at Death.</p>
            <p>These things having been buzzed in the ears of the Multitude, to have been done in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Way, the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> thought it a fit time to lay hold on their Discontents, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37916:15"/> raised all the Forces he could, calling in the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and imploring the other <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Nations</hi> to assist him, as he pretended, to prevent Heresies over-running that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; nor was the Pope, to whom he had sent one <hi>Stewkley,</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Renagado, as his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, wanting to further his Design, causing 600 Harquibussers to be levied in the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of the Church, for the Service of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone:</hi> But <hi>Stewkley,</hi> who commanded them, coming into the Port of <hi>Lisbon</hi> with them, at what time King <hi>Don Sebastian</hi> was going to invade <hi>Africa,</hi> he retained them for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, when at the fatal Battel of <hi>Alcazaz</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Moors,</hi> they were all cut to pieces: However, <hi>Tyrone</hi> being very much strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, gave the <hi>English</hi> a great Overthrow, and put all <hi>Connaught, Ʋlster</hi> and <hi>Munster</hi> in Arms; and the War after that went on with doubtful Success, sometimes one Party prevailed, and sometimes another. Here the famous Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> the great Favourite of Queen <hi>Elizabetb,</hi> commanded; but whilst he was fighting in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he was undermined by his Foes at the <hi>English</hi> Court, and being called home, and some Misdemeanours in this War, and other things charged against him, he was confined to his House, where falling into Discontent, he after having imprisoned the Privy Counsellors that were sent to him from the Queen, he broke out into open Violence, for which he lost his Head on <hi>Tower-hill.</hi> The Fall of so brave a Souldier proving afterward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Lord <hi>Norrice</hi> being Deputy of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the stead of the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> he followed his business so close, that giving <hi>Tyrone</hi> several Overthrows, and beating out the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that came to his Assistance, he at last was left by his Followers, who cursing him for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into such Troubles, shifted as they could; so that after he had lurked up and down some Months, suffering extream Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, he came and surrendred himself to the Lord-Deputy, upon promise he should be sent over to <hi>England,</hi> there to throw himself at the Queen's Feet for Mercy; and according he was sent over and committed to the <hi>Tower;</hi> but the Queen dying before he could be brought to Trial, King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and First of <hi>England,</hi> coming to the Crown, he was by an Act of Indempnity par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and set at Liberty, he and all his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, promising exact Obedience for the future; and that wise King knowing how to settle a troublesome Nation, as having been brought up in one himself, he knew it was best to prevent and lay aside Animosities, and therefore by his Proclamation of Pardon, he utterly extinguished all Offences, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Crown, but between Subject and Subject, as to particular Trespasses; and the like to every one that at a set day would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and claim the Benefit of his Pardon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Justice of Assize, and Publick Justice for that purpose being setled in every County,

            <p>Troubles arising in the Year 1641. thro' a Mis-understanding, and fomented Heats blown by secret Enemies, and War being in prospect between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Native <hi>Irish</hi> Chiefs, not finding the People prone to hearken to them, incited the Popish Priests, who by promising them Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for Obedience to their Commands, and Damnation on the contrary, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther strange Stories and Things, pushed them headlong on to one of the blackest Iniquities the Sun has for many Ages beheld, and was too late discovered to be prevented, for it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that on the 23d of <hi>October,</hi> the <hi>Irish</hi> headed by a great many of their Nobility and Gentry, rose generally in Arms, seizing upon divers strong Places, Arms, Ammunition, and all that came to hand, vowing the utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of all the <hi>English</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate them from the face of the <hi>Irish</hi> Earth,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37916:17"/> both Root and Branch; and this was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered but one Night before it was to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; by which Providence however <hi>Dublin</hi> and some other Places, by the Imprisoning the Conspirators, and Fortifying them with good Garisons, were secured, and became a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to the Lives of many; so that now one might every where behold Houses flaming, the miserable People fly every where for their Lives, whilst the Blood of many were ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Flames, and the Earth made red by the Blood of those that were slaughtered in the Fields and Ways; thousands were drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Rivers and Lakes till the Stream was glutted with the dead Bodies, and they Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the Waters; many were ripped up alive, and others tortured in a more cruel man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; some were turned out into Snows and Frost and starved to death; the Priests and Fryers going along with the Murtherers, and beating them on to it with their Crucifixes, telling them, <hi>They were Hereticks, and no longer to be suffered alive on the Earth; and that it was so far from a sin to kill them, that it was Meritorious, and even Damnation it self to spare them;</hi> giving the Sacrament to the more scrupulous of Conscience to confirm them in the Bloudy Enterprize; so that in a short space, before any Succour could come from <hi>England,</hi> they destroyed by sundry barbarous ways 20000 Men, Women, and Children, burnt most of their Houses and Villages, killing their Cattel, and suffering them to rot upon the Ground, rooting up likewise their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37916:17"/> newly sprouted Corn, as maliciously bent not only to destroy the People, but in Hatred and utter Detestation all that appertained to them; flattering themselves by the Inducement of old lying Prophesies, to shake off the <hi>English</hi> Yoke, and choose them a King from among their Country-men, but Face consented not.</p>
            <p>The King was at the beginning of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Mischief in <hi>Ireland,</hi> upon the Borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> labouring to compose the Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; recommending the Care of <hi>Ireland</hi> to his Parliament then sitting at <hi>Westminster,</hi> who promised a speedy Relief and Assistance to the Protestants that were got together in Arms, and stood upon their Defence; Voting 50000 pound for to raise Forces; and the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> was made Lieutenant-General of the Royal Forces in that Kingdom; to joyn whom Sir <hi>Simon Harcourt</hi> was sent out of <hi>England</hi> with a Regiment. So that the poor Remnant of the Protestants getting together, made the <hi>Irish</hi> Papist that was so good at base and unmanly Murthers, fly the Face of War. But Troubles growing fast on in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by the Misunderstanding between King <hi>Charles</hi> the First and his Parliament, and sprouting up into a miserable Civil War, most of the guilty Persons at this time escaped un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished: But the small Force of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants that were left, being once united, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the <hi>Irish</hi> out of their strong Hold, and restored the Face of Government; yet about eight Years after a Bloody Scene was acted, for King <hi>Charles</hi> the First loosing his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37916:18"/> with his Life, his Eldest Son <hi>Charles,</hi> as his undoubted Right, taking upon him the Kingly Dignity, though in Exile, <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cast, as they termed it, into a Model of a Free State or Republick, the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Lord-Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioned to Labour the Securing that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to the behoof of his Master King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; and finding no other Means to do it in that Imergency, he closed his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest with the Chief of the leading <hi>Irish,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding a Peace in the King's Name, with the most considerable of them, upon Submission and Obedience to his Majesty, there being a Concession of certain Articles on the part of the Marquess to be performed, when being joyned by the Marquess of <hi>Clanricard,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Inchequeen,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Trim</hi> and <hi>Tredah</hi> or <hi>Drogheda,</hi> upon a Defeat they gave the Forces that came from <hi>England,</hi> surrendered: and now <hi>Dublin,</hi> wherein was a strong Garison commanded by Colonel <hi>Jones,</hi> being the only place of strength that held out, the Marquess laid Siege to it, with a brave Army to appearance, but it seems there were too many <hi>Irish</hi> in it, for the Besieged taking the advantage of the carelesness of the Camp, made at first very slender Sallies, but finding the advantage, they sallied with their whole strength, and beating the Besiegers out of their Works, followed them into their Camp, which occasioned such Terrour and Confusion, that the <hi>Irish</hi> fled, and left the <hi>English</hi> and some few <hi>French</hi> to stand to it, but being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37916:18"/> by the vigorous Attacks, they at length, after a sharp and bloody Dispute, gave way, and were forced to raise the Siege, whilst the Besieged became Masters of their Camp, and an extraordinary rich Booty; and more Forces arriving from <hi>England,</hi> Fortune went against them almost every where. And now <hi>London-Derry</hi> being besieged, that Siege was raised by Sir <hi>Charles Coot;</hi> but what yet was a greater Terrour, <hi>Cromwell,</hi> a vowed and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemy to the <hi>Irish,</hi> landed with seven Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Foot, four Regiments of Horse, and one of Dragoons, bringing along with him the Title of Lord Governour, or Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had to bring over these Forces forty Sail of Ships, with battering Pieces, Mortars, Ammunition, and all other Warlike Stores and Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.</p>
            <p>He staid a while to visit <hi>Dublin,</hi> and then marched with a compleat Army to besiege <hi>Drogheda,</hi> wherein was a strong Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> it being upon the Rumour of his Approach reinforced with Two thousand five hundred Foot, and Three hundred Horse; and although it was stoutly defended, yet it was carried by Force, and by the too cruel Order of the General, all were put to the Sword, not respecting Age nor Sex, except a very few who hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for many Days, till the Fury was over: And here it is the more to be lamented, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Brunt fell mostly upon many brave <hi>English</hi> Gentlemen, who were got into the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37916:19"/> Place to Defend it for their King. Other Towns were likewise taken by Storm, and treated at the like rate; so that a bloody Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance seemed to fall heavy upon a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that were Innocent for the Sins of the Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who had so lately polluted the Land with Innocent Blood, and now kept mostly out of the way in the Mountains, Bogs, and Fastnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; however, being at last hunted from place to place, a great number fell by the Sword, Famine, and Pestilence, insomuch that the Land was greatly Depopulated, a third part of the People being wasted, and had severe Task-Masters over them that made them Groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Burthens, till <hi>Charles</hi> the Second came to lighten their Sholders, and restore them again their Peace and Ease, by Accession to the Crown upon the Happy Restauration; so that the People wearied with their former Miseries, began to be out of love with War and Insurrections, and seemed mightily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to Peace. And indeed the King took care to place such Ministers of State amongst them, especially the Lords Lieutenants and Lords Justices, that they had no reasonable cause to complain of their Usage, either in Affairs Civil or Military; and indeed the Tranquility the Kingdom enjoyed, made the People in a great measure forget what they had suffered: They traded to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> with the product of their Native Soil; the Rivers and Lakes likewise affording them plenty of Fish, which they transported for Wine and other Commodities. Nor did their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37916:19"/> Thoughts appear to be elevated above what was reasonable, till the Death of the King. But when King <hi>James</hi> the Second ascended his Brother's Throne, and declared himself a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> then it was the <hi>Irish</hi> Papists began to prick up their Ears, and to expect Advantages beyond their Abilities, publickly declaring, <hi>The Day was their own, and that the Protestant Religion must go down.</hi> But it seems in this, as in their other Aims, they took such Measures as made them shoot wide of their Mark.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> who had been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by King <hi>James,</hi> when Duke of <hi>York,</hi> from a mean to a considerable Figure, was looked upon as a fit Instrument to carry on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in that Kingdom; and therefore upon the re-calling of the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> he was made Lord-Lieutenant, and soon gave the <hi>Irish</hi> great Hopes of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority over the <hi>English</hi> in that Kingdom, by first Cashiering the Protestant Soldiers and Officers that were in Arms, and then the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Ministers of Justice: And though there were Complaints made against him at the <hi>English</hi> Court, yet they were not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but he the rather encouraged in his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes; insomuch, that things run so high that many feared a fatal Event, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers left thereupon the Kingdom; some going for <hi>Holland,</hi> others for <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England:</hi> and in such a method Matters continued to be pushed violently on, till News came of a purposed Invasion of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37916:20"/> Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> by the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi> now our Soveraign, then <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> bestir'd himself to secure <hi>Ireland,</hi> Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning such as he suspected, and Disarming others; draining the Garrisons of the most expert <hi>Irish</hi> Soldiers that were Papists, and sending them over to the number of Three thousand, or thereabout, to the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of his Master; but they did him far more hurt than good by increasing the Peoples Fears that were but before sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted. And indeed, the whole <hi>English</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Revolting in a manner from King <hi>James,</hi> and what was more remarkable, a great part of the Army he had been so long Training up at a vast Expence. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Landing of the Prince with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the <hi>Irish</hi> Forces that had been sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in expectation of Mountains, found that they were not only dwindled into less than Mole-hills, but themselves in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Condition, not only at the point of starving when Disbanded with the rest of the Forces, by the Earl of <hi>Feversham,</hi> but almost exposed to the Fury and violent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment of the People, who had conceived a Hatred against them; so that at last, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, they were taken care of, and most of them shipped for the Emperour's Service a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Turks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> was not idle in <hi>Ireland</hi> upon the News he had from <hi>England</hi> of King <hi>James</hi> his Flight to <hi>France;</hi> but calling a Council mostly of his Creatures, told them,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37916:20"/>
               <hi>That now it was their time to stand up for their Country, and secure it against all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers; and that for his part, if even his Master should command him to deliver up the Sword, he should think it, in such a Juncture, his Duty to Refuse it.</hi> And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately not only spread the News throughout the Country, but caused the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi> every where to take Arms, such as they could get; so that the Tumultuous Rabble getting together, plundered the Protestant Houses, drove away their Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, fired their Stacks of Corn and Hay, murthered some, and barbarously used o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, insomuch that the Terrour work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all, such as could fled for their Lives, leaving their Substance behind them, and happy they thought themselves in that Condition, if they could pass the Seas, either to <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland;</hi> for although several of the Protestant Nobility and Gentry made Head in the <hi>North,</hi> yet the Enemy having in their Possession all the strong Towns, they found themselves too weak to make any extraordinary Resistance against so mighty a Torrent as came roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on; however, they gave several of their Parties notable Overthrows, fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>London-Derry, Slego,</hi> and the Isle of <hi>Innis killing,</hi> and such other Places and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties of Access as they found Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; for by this time <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Orders for stopping the Ports, and made many large and plausible Offers to bring them
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37916:21"/> over to his Party, but they prevailed on a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few.</p>
            <p>The Prince and Princess being proclaimed King and Queen of <hi>England, France</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> on the 14th of <hi>February,</hi> 1688. upon the Humble Address of both Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, great care was taken for the speedy succouring the oppressed Protestants of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that the Papists in Arms against them, might be left without Excuse, a Proclamation was sent over, offering, among other things, a Pardon and Indempnity for all that should in Obedience to it lay down their Arms and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to their respective places of Abode, and there peaceably behave themselves as obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Subjects ought to do, upon which Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they should in full Freedom enjoy their Estates according to Law, and that the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> upon such a Consideration should have all the Favour that the Law allows for the private Exercise of their Religion; with a further Promise, That a Parliament should be speedily called in that Kingdom: But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on refusing to comply with the Royal Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, to be esteemed as Rebels and Traytors to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. their Lands and Possessions to be Forfeited, and disposed of by way of Distribution among those that should be Aiding and Assisting in the Reducing the Kingdom to its Obedience.</p>
            <p>This Royal Concession, though <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured what in him lay to hinder its being dispersed, wrought some good Effects, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that Earl, to counter-ballance it,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37916:21"/> put forth a Paper which he termed his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, not only therein insinuating what great Advantage the Kingdom would reap by stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out. But that their Fears might be dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he promised speedy Aids and Succours from <hi>France,</hi> and that they should not want for either Money or Provision, and moreover, the better to encourage them, gave hopes of King <hi>James</hi>'s speedy landing there with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Army. And the better to secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and keep up the Courage of his Party he sent out Detachments to secure divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Gentlemen in the Country, and make Garrisons of their Houses. But the greatest part of them having timely notice, made their Escapes; by which the Protestants grew stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the <hi>North;</hi> however their Goods and Possessions were destroyed and harassed. The Priests being the greatest Incendiaries to stir up those that were actually in Arms to Spoil and Rapine, as being sure of a share, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to Arm the madding Multitude; so that one might see Droves of the latter, some half naked, others tattered, and all in miserable Rags, armed with Pitchforks, Bills, Staves, and what other merciless Weapons they could get on the suddain, running like so many Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to spoil and plunder, and in their gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness of Prey, not many times distinguishing Papists from Protestants. And it was strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reported, That there was a great Debate in the Council, to which some Popish Bishops were admitted, about a General Massacre, as the best Expedient to clear the Country of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37916:22"/> Hereticks: But <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> (let it be to his praise) had the Generosity to oppose and detest it, and put a stop in some measure to the mischievous progress of the Rabble, yet when some of the Chiefs who had got Protections from him, made their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints: <hi>That they were notwithstanding plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered:</hi> He only shook his Head, and told them, <hi>It was Necessity that made his Men to do it, and he could no ways help or restrain it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These violent proceedings made those that thought upon the Earl's Protection, they might have some confidence in their continuance as to safety, begin to make away for the Sea-coast; and although the Masters of Ships were commanded on pain of Death to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport none, yet many escaped to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> where they were well received, and Provision made for them by way of Publick Brief and Collection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the latter end of <hi>March</hi> the Abdica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted King landed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> with a great Train of Officers, but very few Forces, and was received at <hi>Dublin</hi> with a mixture of Joy and Sorrow, bringing with him as his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervisor Monsieur <hi>D'Avaux,</hi> with some <hi>French</hi> Generals. The <hi>Recorder</hi> of <hi>Dublin</hi> made a long Speech to him upon his Arrival, extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him for Courage, Conduct, and all the Heroick Vertues imaginable, above the Skies; and a general Joy spread in the faces of the Roman Catholicks, thinking now the day was all their own, and not doubting to carry
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37916:22"/> every thing by force or submission; and more Soldiers were Listed and Regimented under the <hi>French</hi> Officers that came over, and care taken to lay up Stores. Money was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where extorted, and the plundered Cattel, Corn and Hay brought in, and sold at incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Rates; insomuch that they soon ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered an Army of between Forty and Fifty Thousand Men.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were doing at Land, the <hi>English</hi> Navy being out at Sea with a strict Charge to hinder Correspondence between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Squadron under the Command of Admiral <hi>Herbert,</hi> had Notice by their Scout Ships, that part of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet was abroad, and stood away to the <hi>Irish</hi> Coast: Whereupon he made all the Sail he could after them, and the next Day found they stood into <hi>Bantry Bay,</hi> a very spacious bearing in of the Sea, and though for fear of the Shallows, and other Difficulties that might offer, it proved a work of Difficulty to enter upon them, for they seemed no ways willing to come out to an Engagement, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they were much superiour in number; yet the Admiral drawing his Ships into a Line, and lying upon the stretch, bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them extreamly from Ten in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till Five in the Afternoon, at what time the <hi>French</hi> Admiral tacked from us, and stood farther into the Bay. We killed them a great many Men; and some of our Men delared, they saw one of their great Ships go to the bottom. On our side we lost Captain <hi>Aylmer</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:37916:23"/> of the <hi>Portland,</hi> with a Lieutenant, and about Three hundred Seamen killed and wounded, and could our Fireships have entred upon them, most of their Ships, which were Forty four in number, to about Twenty eight of ours, might have been destroyed.</p>
            <p>Our Fleet after this Engagement came back to <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> and there refitted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King of <hi>England</hi> went to take a view of them, and Dining aboard the Admiral, created him Earl of <hi>Torrington,</hi> &amp;c. and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed about Six thousand pound among the Seamen.</p>
            <p>And now the <hi>French</hi> having violated the Peace, and undeniably begun the War in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading <hi>Ireland,</hi> the King delayed not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the War against them by a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that purport, bearing Dare the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of <hi>May,</hi> 1689. and great Preparations were made for passing over to <hi>Ireland,</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were Levied in all parts of <hi>England,</hi> and Money prepared for defraying the Charge of the Expedition; which was the more facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, upon the Estates of <hi>Scotland</hi> submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Crown to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and taking of them upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing owned and invested King and Queen of that Kingdom, which they did by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, who waited upon Their Majesties to that purpose, in the <hi>Banquetting-House</hi> at <hi>Whitehall.</hi> And the Viscount of <hi>Dundee,</hi> who had headed the Rebel <hi>Highlanders,</hi> and others in that Kingdom, being killed in a fatal Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel near St. <hi>Johnstown,</hi> things began to go
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37916:23"/> better, and the Success of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Affairs gave way to a more speedy prosecuting those in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the <hi>Inniskilling-men</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, pierced the Enemies Quarters, and got great Booties, defeating divers Parties, and making themselves terrible to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>Upon News brought that <hi>Maccarty</hi> was in those Parts with a strong Party, plundering and ravaging the Country. Lieutenant-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Berry,</hi> with three Companies of Foot, eight Troops of Horse, and three of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, marched towards them; but upon their approach, found they were made stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than they were reported, by another Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that had joyned them, and were much su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to him in number; which obliged him before he found himself sufficiently strong to attack them, to send to Colonel <hi>Woolsey</hi> at <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niskilling,</hi> for a Re-inforcement; which he no sooner obtained, but he charged them with much bravery, killing a considerable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, taking some Prisoners, and putting the rest to flight; but the Flyers in their way being greatly re-inforced, rallied, and came to second Encounter, which for a time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued bloody and doubtful, they by reason of their advantageous Post, much galling our Horse with their Cannon; but the Defiles, or dirty narrow Passages being resolutely passed by our Foot and Dragoons, they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Masters of the Cannon, which gave our Horse the advantage to charge the Enemies Horse, who thereupon deserted the Foot and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37916:24"/> fled, and the Foot after them, a great many being killed, and some taken Prisoners, by which Defeat the Country was freed from great Incumbrances. This part of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Army that had a long time lain heavy upon it, being by this means, and in this Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, fell of the Enemy by the Sword, and those that were drowned in desperately throwing themselves into the Lough to escape the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suers, about Three thousand.</p>
            <p>There happened likewise divers other Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters of lesser note, wherein the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants for the greatest part gained the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were doing, the <hi>Irish</hi> Army, with King <hi>James</hi> at the Head of it, marched towards <hi>London-Derry,</hi> promising themselves, the Terrour of their Arms would oblige it to a Surrender upon their first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; but found they were extreamly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken; for although Colonel <hi>Lundy</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and the two Regiments sent from <hi>England,</hi> under the Colonels <hi>Cunningham</hi> and <hi>Richards,</hi> had withdrawn and slighted it, as a place not tenable against an Army of Forty thousand Men, with a Train of Artillery and divers Mortars; Providence so ordered, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Bulwark of the sinking Nation, and gave the Enemy their first considerable check; for divers Troops that were abroad, mostly composed of undisciplined Soldiers, throwing themselves into it, they, together with those that were found there were Regimented, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the multitude seizing the Keys, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37916:24"/> with great alacrity to defend it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving chose Mr. <hi>George Walker,</hi> Minister of an adjacent Village, their Governour, and Major <hi>Baker,</hi> his Co-adjutor, or Assistant-Governour during the Siege. And now those in Arms in the Town consisted of 117 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, and every Company contained sixty Men, being in all 7020 Common Soldiers, and 341 Officers. The next thing taken in hand, was to view the Stores, and ordering their better Security from any Embezling, as resolving to defend the place to the last extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, having already rejected the Offers the Enemy made them, in case they would readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly submit, which consisted of much promised Favour and Protection; but the hard dealings others had met with, who had put themselves into their hands, made them deaf to all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals, and their great Guns being mounted on the Wall, they fired upon the Advance-Guard of the Enemy, who had been promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be received with open Arms, by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> and others, who undertook to bring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the besieged, which much consternated King <hi>James,</hi> then within the reach of their Cannon, and obliged him to remove to a place of more safety.</p>
            <p>However, seeing fair Words and Promises could not gain it, they resolved to reduce it by force, beginning within a day or two after their appearance before it, to break Ground, and run their Trenches, drawing up a Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culverine, within a Furlong of the Town, with which they battered the Market-House,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37916:25"/> and did some damage to other Houses; but the Cannon from the Town playing among them, did considerable Execution; and to hinder their nearer approach, the Besieged sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied, and beat them out of their Trenches, killing about Two hundred Men, amongst whom was the <hi>French</hi> General <hi>Mamow,</hi> and others of Note, with little loss on our side, and of Note, only Lieutenant <hi>Mac Phedris</hi> was killed.</p>
            <p>The Besiegers finding this way little availed them, drew four Demi-Culverine into an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard adjoyning to the Town, and kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Firing, which hurt many People in their Houses, and made some Impressions in the Walls: Nor was the damage left unrequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Cannon of the Town, which killed them a great many Men, and some considerable Officers, and a sudden shot took off two Fryars in their Habits, as they were exhorting the Besieged to press on the Siege.</p>
            <p>And now to do their Work more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, they placed two Mortar-pieces, and threw in divers Bombs, which did some damage to the Houses and People, whereupon the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged sallied, and killed several of the Enemy at <hi>Benburn-Hill,</hi> losing only two of their own and eighteen wounded. The same day a Shot from the Town broke and dismounted one of their Pieces on the Battery, and killed the Gunner, whereupon they drew a Trench a-cross <hi>Windmil-hill,</hi> from the Bog to the River, and there raised another Battery, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37916:25"/> the Hedge with Dragoons; but at the same time the Besieged sallied in a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number, and dividing one part, made them Masters of the Trenches and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Ground, killing about two hundred; whilst the other Party beat the Dragoons from the Hedges. Which reiterated Losses so enraged the Enemy, that having Captain <hi>Cunningham,</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Douglass</hi> upon some Sallies, they, after Quarter given, put them to the Sword, which served to confirm the Besieged in the belief of the Mercy they were to expect if they fell into their hands, and made them more obstinate in a resolute Defence: and alluring the Governour out, under pretence of Treaty, they fired a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Shot at him, yet none of them had the power to hurt him, by reason upon their first presenting, he sheltred him behind the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of an old House, and retired into the Town, cautious how he trusted them any more.</p>
            <p>The Besiegers by this time grown weary of continual Duty, and the danger they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to, drew off their main Body, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped on a Hill about two miles from the Town, yet left it entirely besieged.</p>
            <p>On the Fourth of <hi>June,</hi> a Squadron of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntier Horsmen, who promised upon Oath to do great things, supported by a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Foot, made an Attack upon the <hi>Windmil</hi>-work, resolving to force the Line, coming on with loud Shouts and Huzza's; but were frustrated in their Enterprize, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37916:26"/> beat off with considerable loss, Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them were accounted to be killed; and to secure their Retreat, the Foot car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Faggots at their Backs, and those that had none, hoised the dead Bodies, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them away on their Backs to dead the shot.</p>
            <p>On the part of the Besieged, the loss was very inconsiderable, only Captain <hi>Butler</hi> pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing too eagerly after the Enemy, was taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, and a few killed by a great shot coming over the River.</p>
            <p>These several Defeats and Disappointments of taking a place they before had thought so easie, that the <hi>French</hi> General upon the first view, swore he would beat down the Walls with Pot-Guns, so enraged the Enemy, that they were resolved to make all the effort imaginable, and the next night played Bombs, some of them 273 pounds, which broke up the Streats, beat down several Houses, and killed divers Persons; which occasioned some consternation, and the more when their Stores of Provision began to fail, and Famine to encrease, so that they needs must have been disheartned, had they not been encouraged by the discovery of Thirty Sail of Ships in the Lough, which were sent to their Succour from <hi>England,</hi> under the Command of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-General <hi>Kirk,</hi> with Provision, Men, and Ammunition: But the River being chained up with a floating Boom a cross it, and Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of the Enemy on the Bank, he could not only for several days get up, but had much
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37916:26"/> ado to have Communication by Letter; yet the hope of Relief so near at hand, kept up the Spirits of the Besieged, and encouraged them to a vigorous Defence, though many died daily for want.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Rosen</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Marshal, by this time arrived in the Enemies Camp, and understanding the little progress they had made in carrying on the Siege, fell a swearing, <hi>By the Belly of God, he would not only demolish the Town, but bury the Besieged in their own Ruins.</hi> But upon the Attacks he made, found no better Success than the rest: and the Lord <hi>Clancarty,</hi> who they said was desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by an old Prophecy to take the Town, making an Attack, and being beat off with great loss, Lieutenant-General <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who had falsified his Trust to King <hi>William,</hi> and revolted to the Enemy, upon his being sent from <hi>England</hi> to pacifie Matters in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, came to make large Offers, but was rejected by the Besieged with Indignation; nor was <hi>Rosen</hi>'s Promises and Threats regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Whereupon he pitched upon a <hi>French</hi> Politick, imagining that would infallibly do, <hi>viz.</hi> he caused all the miserable Protestants to be gathered out of the Countries round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and driven half naked and starved there to perish, if the Besieged refused to succour them, whose Wants, though they pierced their Hearts, having very slender Provision in the Town, they could not relieve, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore kept the Gates shut against them, yet fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red among the Enemies Party that drove
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37916:27"/> them, four or five of them fell dead with the Shot. And now there being several Prisoners in the Town, who had several Relations of Note and Command in the Enemies Camp, the Governour, and the rest, caused a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to be set up in the sight of the Enemy, threatning to hang the Prisoners thereon, if those miserable People were not suffered to return to their Habitations, yet leave given them to write to their Friends, to know what they would do on their behalf. <hi>Rosen</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them no Answer; but <hi>Hamilton</hi> returned them a slight one. However, this Stratagem prevailed, and the People were permitted to return; which proved advantageous to the Garrison; for amongst them five or six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred poor Starvlings were shuffled out, and some able Bodies taken in.</p>
            <p>Another Stratagem they had to shoot Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the Town in the dead Shell of a Bomb, <hi>viz.</hi> not filled with Powder, as imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Governour, and other Superiour Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers kept their Proposals from the Soldiers; but this enraged them the more, and it was made Death so much as to discourse of a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render. About the Thirtieth of <hi>June,</hi> Major <hi>Baker</hi> died; yet the Defence continued as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous as ever, and divers Sallies were made, though the Garrison through Famine, Diseases and Loss was lessened near one half, and the Famine increased so fast, that Horse-flesh was sold for Eighteen pence the pound, and but little of that to be had: A Quarter of a Dog, that fead upon the dead <hi>Irish,</hi> at Five shillings
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37916:27"/> and six pence, his Head at half a crown, a Cat at four shillings and six pence; Rats, Mice, Tallow, Greves, and all noysome things that could be possibly eaten, proportionably; so that in the whole Town there was but nine lean Horses left, and a pint of Meal, and a little Tallow to each Man, when Providence so ordered, whilst they were at their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, News came that Ships were making their way up the River; which to their great Joy and Comfort proved true: for Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Kirk</hi> having notice that the Town could hold out no longer, ordered the <hi>Mountjoy</hi> and <hi>Phoenix,</hi> and <hi>Mountjoy</hi> guarded by the <hi>Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> to force their way at any hazard, which they did through the Showers of the Enemies Shot, and found the Boom broke; one of them however struck upon a shelve, yet the Stock of her Guns set her free again, and they came safe to the Town, bringing Life to a dying People: which the Enemy perceiving, thought it to no purpose of staying longer before it, least they should receive worse disgrace, but in some confusion raised their Camp, firing <hi>Culmore,</hi> and divers other Places in their Retreat, breaking for haste some of their great Guns; and had a Party of the <hi>Inniskilling</hi>-Men, and some of the Garrison up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Rear, who cut off, or took Prisoners the Straglers, with some Booty; the former having before defeated Lieutenant-General <hi>Maccarty,</hi> they likewise threw about twelve Cart-load of Arms into the River for want of Carriages to bear them off; and lost before
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:37916:28"/> the Town in a Siege of one hundred and five Days, for so long it lasted, between 18 and 19000 Men, and among them 100 of their best Officers.</p>
            <p>And now pardon me, Reader, for insisting so long upon this particular, which I could not slightly pass over, since (if we consider the Weakness of the Place, few of the Men that defended trained up in War, and Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city it endured, and the time it held out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a powerful Army, backed by almost a whole Kingdom) it may very well compare with the most famous Siege that ever was mentioned in History.</p>
            <p>Major-General <hi>Kirk</hi> soon after these Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours got in, came to <hi>London-Derry,</hi> and was received with all the Demonstrations of Joy a People in so ruinous a Condition, could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow; and having viewed the Walls and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, blessed himself to think that such slight Works could ever have been defended so long against such an Army.</p>
            <p>Things in <hi>London-Derry</hi> being settled as well as the shortness of time would permit, it was agreed that Mr. <hi>Walter</hi> should go for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and present his Majesty with an Address in his own, and the Names of the principal Persons that had been in the Town during the Siege; where he was very graciously recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and his Majesty, as a Mark of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, for the signal Services he had done him, ordered him 5000 pound, and a Promise of his further Regard. Whilst this Siege lasted, the <hi>Inniskilling</hi>-Men and others of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:37916:28"/> Party abroad were not idle, but a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of 600 Men were sent under the Cammand of Colonel <hi>Stewart,</hi> got into the Isle of <hi>Inch;</hi> and hearing the <hi>Irish</hi> had forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied themselves in <hi>Tully,</hi> he sent a commanded Party of sixty Musquetiers, and beat them out, when more Forces coming to him, he and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commanders raised some small Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in the Island, and there succoured a great many Protestants who fled from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy with their Cattel and Substance, and others that had been stripped of all, and came naked; beating divers Parties of the <hi>Irish</hi> that attempted to force him from his strength; and the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> being sent this way with 1500 Horse, attempted to force <hi>Ralfamulin,</hi> where a small Party of our Men quartered; but having timely notice, getting to their Arms, and Barrocading the Street, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, after a sharp Dispute, drew off with the Loss of 240 Men; and on our part only Lieutenant <hi>Coningham,</hi> and a few private Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and a Lieutenant wounded: However, very desirous to bring these Parts into Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nothing was omitted that Threats or Alurements could effect; but neither of them prevailed against the stedfast Loyalty of the Protestants; they too sadly remembred how often they had broke their words, and how little they esteemed keeping it with those they termed Hereticks. One fatal Instance of which take for many:</p>
            <p>It happened that the Lord <hi>Galmoy</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad with a Party, took Captain <hi>Dixie</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:37916:29"/> by surprize in his Father's House, which House he set on fire, and with him brought away <hi>Cornet Charlton:</hi> but hearing one <hi>Brian Mac Kinghor Mac Gurrie,</hi> a Captain of the <hi>Irish</hi> Army, had been taken by our Men, and was Prisoner at <hi>Cran,</hi> he sent to the Governor of the Castle, to offer Captain <hi>Dixie</hi> in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, vowing upon his Honour, so soon as <hi>Gurrie</hi> came, <hi>Dixie</hi> should be sent them. This was well accepted, and <hi>Guerrie</hi> was sent, but <hi>Galmoy</hi> thereupon ordered the two Young Gentlemen to be tried by a Council of War, for receiving a Commission from <hi>England;</hi> and being sentenced, had orders to prepare to die the next day, but in the mean time great Endeavours were used, and Promises made them of Life and Preferment, if they would turn Papists, and adhere to King <hi>James.</hi> But they generously rejected the Offer, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred their Religion before the saving their Lives; and although <hi>Mac Gurrie</hi> interceded mainly for them, and reproached the Lord <hi>Galmoy</hi> with the Stain of his Honour after his solemn Promise in Writing; yet he would hear nothing on their behalf, but caused them to be hanged upon one <hi>Russel</hi>'s Sign-Post; whilst he made merry there; and not content with their Lives, he ordered their Heads to be cut off, and tossed to the Soldiers to play at Foot-ball with, which when they had mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used for a time, he caused to be set up on the Market-Cross at <hi>Belturbet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This made, I say, the rest more cautious to trust their Mercy; whereupon the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:37916:29"/> General <hi>Rosne,</hi> resolute to subdue them, came within the shot of their Cannon to encourage the Soldiers that were gathering in those parts against them, but a shot had spoiled his Undertaking, had it not fallen a little too short, yet it beat up the Stones, which wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the Leg, and his Horse in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and killed two Troopers, insomuch, that frighted with this Disaster, he gave over the Attempt: But greater Actions than these at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Fate of <hi>Ireland;</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Army so long expected was embarqued, and came on with a fair Wind, being discovered some Leagues at Sea, by the longing People who watched for it on the shore, and proclaimed its arrival by their loud Shouts and Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Joy: and on the Thirteenth of <hi>August,</hi> 1689. Duke <hi>Schombergh,</hi> who commanded the Forces, landed at <hi>Carickfurgus;</hi> and after a short Enquiry into the state of the Kingdom, he sent two Regiments to <hi>Belfast;</hi> and having refreshed himself, and that part of the Army that landed with him, he directed his March to find out the Enemy, being every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Protestants with the greatest Expressions of joy imaginable: At the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of whose approach the Castle and Town of <hi>Antrim</hi> was deserted, and our Men took possession of it, leaving there a Garrison of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Soldiers, under the Command of Captain <hi>Ormsby;</hi> and many other Places and Passes were secured: But <hi>Carickfurgus</hi> refusing upon Summons to Surrender, a part of the Army sate down before it; and the next day the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:37916:30"/> Cannon and Mortars were planted against it whilst the Trenches were opened, and no sooner they heard the <hi>English</hi> speak to them in a Dialect of War, from the mouths of their Cannon, but they beat a Parley; but the main import of their Request being to send to King <hi>James</hi> to have his leave to Surrender: it was rejected, and the Mortars and Cannon began to play against the Town very furiously, they answering us with their Cannon in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, especially anoying our Men with two Pieces advantageously planted in the Lord <hi>Dungale</hi>'s House; yet our Bombs did great Execution, beating down and setting many Houses on fire. Several of our Ships that lay in a Line, played likewise their Cannon on the other side, and no less indamaged the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged; whereupon they again desired a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, but insisting to March out with their Cloaths and Baggage, the Duke would not agree to it, only allowing them to be Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of War; and again the Batteries were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; they again hung out a white Flag to Parley, and upon submitting to a Surrender, were allowed to be conducted to the next <hi>Irish</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison; whereupon Sir <hi>Henry Ingoldsby</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in with his Regiment, and took possession of the Place.</p>
            <p>By this time fifty Sail of Ships came up the Lough, on board which were a Regiment of Horse, and four of Foot, who joyning the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the General marched towards <hi>Belfast,</hi> and were two miles beyond <hi>Lisneygarney</hi> on the 2d of <hi>September,</hi> which made the Enemy retreat
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37916:30"/> with much Precipitation; yet they took so much time as to set divers Places on fire; whereat the General was so incensed, that he sent to tell the Commanders of those Parties, <hi>That if they desisted not from using such</hi> French <hi>Tricks, they must expect no Quarter, if they fell into his hands;</hi> which made them upon quitting <hi>Dundalk</hi> leave it intire.</p>
            <p>The Duke finding the Plains of <hi>Dundalk</hi> commodious to Encamp on, and the Winter Season approaching, caused the Tents to be pitched, whilst the Enemy's Army between 40 and 50000 fortified and entrenched about <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Slego</hi> being still in the hands of the <hi>English,</hi> a Party of the Enemy consisting of about 5000 Horse and Foot, advanced that way in hopes by Force or Surprize to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Masters of it: But Colonel <hi>Lloyd,</hi> who Commanded the <hi>Inniskilling</hi>-Men, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their Design, drew out about a 1000 Horse, Dragoons, and Foot, and Lining the Hedges of the <hi>Lane</hi> of <hi>Boyle,</hi> where they were to pass, with his Foot, he drew up his Horse on a rising ground, and charged the Enemy so suddenly, that after a smart Engagement he put them to Flight in great Confusion; and taking a nearer way with his Horse and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, got into <hi>Boyle</hi> before the Enemy, and charged them again in the Front, whilst the Food did the like in the Rear; so that 700 were cut off, and about 400 taken Prisoners, with <hi>O Kelly</hi> their Commander, and forty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers of note; and by this Rout 8000

The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was thus: It happened that 4 Regiments of <hi>French</hi> Protestants were raised in <hi>England</hi> for the Service, and amongst them divers were listed that came over just then by the way of <hi>Holland,</hi> which being done in haste, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels had no time strictly to examine them, so that amongst these there was one <hi>Du Plessey,</hi> who had been formerly a Captain in <hi>France,</hi> and fled thence for a Murther, but now ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as a private Soldier; this Man sent to Monsieur <hi>D'Avaux,</hi> to let him know, <hi>That if he would get him his Pardon in</hi> France, <hi>and let him have the Command of such as he brought over, he would inveagle the Papists that had been unwittingly Regimented to the</hi> Irish <hi>Camp.</hi> Which upon his Trial before a Council of War appearing by his intercepted Letter, and Confession, he, with four others his Accomplices, were found Guilty, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and upon a strict Scrutiny a great many Papists were found in those Regiments, and sent Prisoners to <hi>England.</hi> Providence by this timely Discovery frustrating the Design they might have to Revolt, and endeavour the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scale of Victory, if it came to a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:37916:31"/>
            <p>The Plains of <hi>Dundalk,</hi> by reason of the Fogs and Wetness of the place, incommoding the Camp with Sickness and Inconveniency, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of <hi>November</hi> it broke up, and marched away to the <hi>Newry</hi> Pass; and beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Enemy, possessed themselves of the Town, and upon their Attempting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, were beaten with considerable loss. Brigadier <hi>Stewart</hi> falling upon them with 250 Horse and Foot so resolutely, that they fell into Confusion, thirty being killed on the place, and about eighteen taken Prisoners, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the number five Officers. And Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Woolsey</hi> took <hi>Belturbet</hi> upon the first Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
            <p>Nor did only the Men, but the Women baffle the Courage of the <hi>Irish:</hi> for a strong Party of them attempting to make themselves Masters of the Lady <hi>Newcomens</hi> House, that Heroick fortified it, and garrisoned with her Tenants, beating off the Enemy, and killing several in the Attacks they made, though she had no great Guns, and but a few small shot; whereupon they found themselves obliged to bring some Cannon and a Mortar before it; which caused her to Surrender, in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>That dismissing the Garrison to march with their Baggage to</hi> Lisnigarvy, <hi>she and her Domesticks might continue there in quiet.</hi> But this was not virtually observed; for get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into her House, they took away many things of value.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things happened at Land, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remarkable, and not amiss to be reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37916:32"/> was done on the Water, in the Bay of <hi>Dublin,</hi> in spight of all the Power and Force of the <hi>Irish,</hi> that then possessed that Great City.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Clously Shovel</hi> being on that Coast, after cruising thwart the Bay, he stood into it, and could then perceive a Ship a Mile within the Bar, whereupon resolving to fetch her out, if possible, he came to an Anchor, and went on Board the <hi>Monmouth</hi> Yatch, and at a little more than half Flood, the Wind being Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly, he with that Yatcht, two Men of Wars Hoys, a Catch, and the Pinnace, got over the Barr; whereupon the Ship being aware of his coming, weighed Anchor, and moved up to <hi>Salmon-Pool,</hi> about a Mile nearer to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and there run a-ground, within shot of a <hi>French</hi> Man of War of twelve Guns, and two or three <hi>English</hi> Ships that lay a-ground filled with Soldiers, who continually kept firing at our Vessels; however, they followed the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, and after some dispute, Sir <hi>Clously Sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi> made a sign for the Fireship to enter and bear up; which when the Enemy perceived, they left their Ships, and got away in their Boats; whereupon our Men went on Board her, and having somewhat lightned her, brought her off, in turning out the Wind, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of the Sea, one of Sir <hi>Clously</hi>'s Hoys run a-ground, and could not be got off before the Water fell away from her, so that the rest were forced to lye by her, and get out her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors, ready to heave off, when the Tyde should return; and the Hoy being upon bare
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37916:32"/> ground, thousands of People came upon the Strand, among which was King <hi>James</hi> with his Guards, as Spectators of what might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and two Protestants that had escaped from <hi>Dublin,</hi> got to our armed Boats, and with much supplication intreated to be taken in. However, a <hi>French</hi> Trooper to shew his Bravado, came riding up within half Musquet shot, and reviling our Men as well as he could gabble <hi>English</hi> by the Epithets of <hi>Rebels, &amp;c.</hi> he had so much Courage as to discharge his Pistol at that distance; but a shot from the Boat that lay next the Shoar killed his Horse, whereupon Monsieur pulling off his Boots, left them to our Men, betaking him to his heels as fast as he could run, for fear an unwelcome Messenger should overtake him, and make him pay dear for his Vain-glory.</p>
            <p>The Ship thus taken was the <hi>Pellican,</hi> the biggest of the two <hi>Scotch</hi> Frigots taken by the <hi>French</hi> the precedent Summer, carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty Guns. Three or four of those that were aboard her, were killed by the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our Men, and found dead upon the Deck, besides those that were carried off, as well killed as wounded: and our Vessels ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done what they came for, returned in triumph with their Prize, in the sight of a numerous People, who thought it for the most part safest to keep at a distance.</p>
            <p>This Ship lay here to carry off some of the Protestants Goods that had been seized in <hi>Dublin;</hi> but the Freighters by this means were disappointed of their expectations.</p>

            <p>Colonel <hi>Woolsey</hi> being still abroad with a Party to observe the Enemies Motions, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with him a Party of 700 Men, out of the Regiment of <hi>Kirk, Earl, Grover,</hi> and the <hi>Innis killing</hi> Troops, he ordered half<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Which were, <hi>That the Garrison should march out with their Arms and Baggage;</hi> and accordingly the Castle Gate was delivered about Noon, and the Garrison commanded by one Captain <hi>Darchy,</hi> marched out within an hour after, consisting of 160 Men detached our of several Regiments; and according to Articles agreed on, were guarded to <hi>Cavan:</hi> so that this strong place was reduced with the loss of three Men on our side, and four or five wounded; it being of great Importance to their Majesties Affairs; by reason it opened a free passage into <hi>Connaught,</hi> and all that part of <hi>Leinster</hi> that lies on the <hi>Shannon;</hi> and after

               </gap> Men, he returned to <hi>Belturbet,</hi> and was there reinforced by a Battalion of <hi>Danes,</hi> to enter upon further Action, as he found it advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to the Service. Insomuch, the <hi>Irish</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were so frequently met withal, that they came not abroad so often as they were wont; by which means our Men had the better lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to get in Hay and Corn to the Magazines, which they frequently adventured for in the Enemies Quarters, and for the most part suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded so well, that they mainly encreased the Stores; so that with that, and what came from <hi>England,</hi> the Camp, and Out-Quarters were plentifully supplied; and even the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists chose rather to bring in their Provisions to our Camp than the Enemies, for Self-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, by reason of the disproportion in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as taking valuable Coin in ours, and only Copper and mixed Mettal at a vast dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion; in the other promised to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged hereafter into better Coin, though they knew not when, nor cared to rely upon such uncertainties.</p>
            <p>About this time the damp Fogs arising in the Country, a great many Officers and Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers died in either Camp; but the destruction light mostly on the <hi>French,</hi> in comparison of their number, who coming out of a warm dry Country, could not so well endure the incommoding Vapours and cold Damps, which the frequent Rains that fall in <hi>Ireland,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the Season is any thing considerably advanced towards the Winter Quarter.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:37916:34"/>
            <p>And now that the Blessing of God might be upon Their Majesty's Arms, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments averted, the General caused his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to be published throughout the Camp, and in other places, strictly prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Swearing, Cursing, and Prophaneness in the Officers and Soldiers on pain of Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and such Punishments as might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, which for a time stopped those Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys of Oaths and Curses, that were wont to be heard on every trivial occasion.</p>
            <p>The General went out with a Party to view the Enemies Posts, and Situation of the Country, and upon his return to <hi>Lisburn,</hi> where now his Head-Quarters were, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the welcome News▪ That Colonel <hi>Woosley</hi> marching from <hi>Belturbet</hi> with Seven hundred Foot, and Three hundred Horse, notwithstanding his being discovered by the Centinels, who gave the Alarm, and the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Weather, he got thither half an hour after break of day, and there, contrary to his expectation, found the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> arrived with Twenty five hundred Men, which with the Garrison made up about Four thousand, and these were drawn up in good order near the Fort; yet the Colonel took Courage, resolving to Charge them, ordering his Men as the ground gave opportunity, and soon they joyned in a fierce Encounter, the <hi>Inniskilling</hi>-Men standing to it manfully; so that notwithstanding the great odds, in two hours time they beat the Enemy out of the Field with considerable slaughter; in which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37916:34"/> Action the Duke of <hi>Berwic k</hi> had his Horse shot under him, and Colonel <hi>O Rely,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Cavan</hi> was killed, as also two Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Colonels, and divers other Officers of Note.</p>
            <p>The Enemy beaten out of the Field, our Men too eager of Plunder, entered the Town before they had gained an entire Victory; which the <hi>Irish</hi> perceiving, rallied, and those in the Fort sallied upon them; so that in the scattered disorder they were in, they had been mostly cut off, had not the Colonel with a Reserve of Two hundred and fifty Foot, and Eighty Horse hasted to their rescue, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them leave to get to their Arms, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he beat the Salliers into the Fort, and made the others retire; yet the Town being a Magazine, and full of Plunder, he could not get his Men out, till he was forced to fire it about their Ears, whereby great Stores, of Provisions were consumed; for most of the Houses were filled with Bread, Meal, Oats, and the like, being a Six Months Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for the Garrison: and by this Defeat and the Ruine of the Town, the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> was disappointed of his Design, which by his Orders, was to Post there with Ten Thousand Men, to be composed of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of all the Regiments, and so to keep the Country in awe, and make Incursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as he perceived it advantageous.</p>
            <p>In this Action, on our side were only Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Men killed, of which number were Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Armstrong,</hi> Major <hi>Trahern,</hi> Captain
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37916:35"/>
               <hi>Mayo,</hi> and Captain <hi>La Maugere;</hi> but the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy lost above Three hundred, and Two hundred taken Prisoners; many that fled threw away their Arms and Baggage for haste.</p>
            <p>Upon this Success, Sir <hi>John Lanier</hi> being at the <hi>Newry</hi> with a strong Party, advanced to <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Bedlow</hi> Castle, where was a Company of Foot, consisting of between Thirty and Forty Men; but the Dragoons soon stormed it, killed divers of them, and set the Castle on Fire, and upon their return attacked <hi>Dundalk,</hi> wherein the Enemy had a Garrison; but they kept close and would not venture to sally, and our Men not being strong enough for a formal Siege, plundered the Houses thereabouts, and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away with a considerable Booty.</p>
            <p>About this time the Prince of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> landed with the <hi>Danish</hi> Forces under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for their Majesties Service, and in a short time joyned the Army.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Callimot</hi> attempting to surprize the strong Fort of <hi>Charlemont,</hi> but being too soon discovered, he was obliged to Retreat; which he did with the loss but of one Man.</p>
            <p>Spring coming on, <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth was not altogether unmindful of his Promise, but sent Five thousand <hi>French,</hi> with some Cloaths and Ammunition, in lieu of which Succours, as many <hi>Irish</hi> were sent to <hi>France,</hi> under the leading of Lieutenant General <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carty,</hi> who having been taken Prisoner by the <hi>Inniskilling</hi>-Men upon the great Overthrow,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37916:35"/> had by this time made his escape; for which Colonel <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Governour of <hi>Inniskilling,</hi> where he had been detained Prisoner, was questioned; but upon Trial, producing a Letter from his Superiour Officer, for what he had done, the matter passed over.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Woosley</hi> about this time had the Castle of <hi>Killesandra</hi> delivered to him upon Summons, the Garrison being terrified into a compliance, upon Notice he was about to spring a Mine under it, the Garrison consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 160 Men, were conducted to <hi>Cavan;</hi> and many other Castles and advantageous Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were frighted at the approach of our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or compelled to Surrender; and great Plenty abounded in the <hi>English</hi> Camp, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son those that brought it received Silver Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: when on the other side King <hi>James</hi> had caused Brass Money to be coined, and an Order to pass it at certain Rates, though it was not a Twentieth part of the value; yet prohibited it in Payments in his Custom-house and Exchequer: and having called a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Irish</hi> Parliament, they anulled the Act of Settlement, and all other Acts favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Protestants, relating to Matters Civil or Ecclesiastical; so that Protestant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Ministers were out, and Popish Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Priests advanced to their Benefices, and great Oppressions used on all hands: but whilst this was doing, <hi>Charlemont,</hi> a strong Fortress of the Enemies; that had been all the Winter blocked up, finding no Succours of Provision, though some of our Men got in over
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:37916:36"/> the Morass, which hastened the consumption of their Provision, beat a Parley, and after some debate about Articles they were agreed upon, they being in their Order as followeth:</p>
            <q>
               <p>That all the Garrison, <hi>viz.</hi> the Governour, Officers, Soldiers, Gunners, and all other Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, the Deserters who run from our Camp, since the first of <hi>September</hi> precedent, only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; and all other persons in the said Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, shall wave their Lives secured, and march out with their Arms, Bag and Baggage, Drums beating, Colours flying, Match lighted, and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let in Mouth, each Officer and Soldier Twelve Charges of Powder, with Match and Ball pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable, and their Horses without any mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station in their Persons and Goods now in their possession, not belonging to the Stores upon any pretence whatsoever, that the said Garrison may march the nearest way to <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and not be compelled to march above <hi>8</hi> or <hi>9</hi> miles a day.</p>
               <p>That all sick and wounded Officers, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther persons that are not able to march at present, may remain within the said Garrison, till they are able to march, and then to have a Pass to go to the next <hi>Irish</hi> Garrison.</p>
               <p>That none of the Army under his Grace the Duke of <hi>Schomberg</hi>'s Command, shall enter the said Fort, except such as are appointed by him to take possession, till the Garrison be marched clear out of the Gates.</p>
               <p>That there shall be a sufficient Convoy appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the said Garrison, to conduct it to the place before-mentioned.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:37916:36"/>
               <p>That they shall deliver fully and wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Embezelment or Diminution, all the Stores belonging to the said Fort; and that an Officer shall be immediately admitted to take an Account of them.</p>
               <p>That the Fort shall be put into the possession of such Forces as his Grace shall think fit at Eight of the Clock on <hi>Wednesday</hi> the Fourteenth of <hi>May, 1690.</hi> and the Garrison shall march out an hour before the outward Gate shall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to such Forces as the General shall appoint in case a supply of one Months Provision for <hi>800</hi> men be not brought into the Garrison for Relief between the signing of these Articles, and the time the place is articled to be delivered up.</p>
               <p>That the above-mentioned Articles shall be inviolably, performed on both sides, without any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation, Mental Reservation, or Fraud what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, according to the true Intent and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof.</p>
               <p>Lastly, That all Acts of Hostility shall cease between the said Garrison and Army, so soon as Notice can be given on both sides.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Thus, after a long holding out, this strong Place was forced into a compliance, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Enemy had put such confidence in it, that many of those abroad proposed it as a last Refuge, if things came to a greater Extremity, its Scituation and Strength giving them Incouragement to hope it was Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; and indeed, it had baffled our Men in some Attempts they made on it, and held out so long, contrary to expectation; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37916:37"/> at last, we find that was agreed to be Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred, and accordingly it was Surrendred, and the Governour <hi>Teague O Regan,</hi> and the Garrison, who had near consumed all their Provision, marched out in number 800; they left 17 Pieces of brass Cannon, 2 Mortars, and a considerable quantity of Ammunition. And this Place by Nature and Art being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding strong, greatly availed to the keeping all that part of the Country in awe. And what more exceedingly heartned the Soldiers, was the News that the King of <hi>England</hi> had left <hi>Whitehall</hi> on the fourth of <hi>June,</hi> and was coming for <hi>Ireland</hi> with a considerable Army, great Sums of Money, Stores of Ammunition, and all things necessary for the vigorous car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on and expediting the War. Nor were they deceived in the Report; for on the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>June</hi> he landed at <hi>Carickfergus,</hi> and went from thence to <hi>Belfast,</hi> where he was waited on by Duke <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and many of the great Officers, and with him came not only some of the <hi>Irish</hi> Nobility, but a great many of that Country, who had fled for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to avoid the Danger that threatned from the Papists; and great was the Joy of the Protestants for his Arrival, and as much on the other hand the Terrour and Consternation of the Papists.</p>
            <p>His Majesty, soon after his Landing, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 200000 l. to be brought on shoar, and fifteen Tun of Half-pence and Farthings of the new Tin coin, and gave notice to all the Agents of Regiments to bring in their Accompts within
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:37916:37"/> three days, that they might receive the Moneys due to the Soldiers; and care thereupon was taken to clear their Quarters, and discharge the Country.</p>
            <p>The King thus landed, to the great Joy of all the Protestants, every one laboured who should be formost in shewing their humble Gratitude for his Exposing his Royal Person to so many Dangers for their Safety, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Gentlemen of the County of <hi>Down,</hi> &amp;c. presented this Address.</p>

And now whilst this is doing, let us turn a little towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> and see how Affairs stand in the Metropolis of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>It was not to be doubted, but upon the King's landing with an Additional Army, the Papists would have been more concerned than they were; but I know not upon what false Topick they grounded their Hopes, their Concern was not so great, as might have been
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:37916:38"/> expected from so eminent a Danger; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was to abate the Courage of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, and startle them into a Mistake of some private Design they had against the King; or that they had some old Prophesies, which they too much relied upon for their Success; or that they trusted to the number of their Army, remains doubtful; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they kept up their Courage beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. The Protestants in <hi>Dublin</hi> guessed it proceeded from the false News that 100000 men were ready to rise in <hi>England,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call King <hi>James,</hi> or declare for a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; and that the <hi>French</hi> Fleet being very powerful at Sea, would not fail to intercept the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Return, and so they fancied they had him as it were in a Trap. And indeed in this immergency, the Affronts the Protestants every where received, without any hope of Redress, made them not know what to think of their Condition; nor was it long e're the Chief of them were imprisoned; and the rest were told, <hi>They would be glad e're long to go to Mass in a short time.</hi> And they were put into frequent frights of having their Houses fired about their Ears, or at the least to be plundered of all they had. And it seems it was debated, <hi>That if it came to a Battel, and the</hi> Irish <hi>were worsted, the City should be set on fire, if not the Protestants massacred.</hi> But it is said King <hi>James</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it; and on the 16th of <hi>July</hi> marched out of <hi>Dublin,</hi> to joyn with about 5000 Foot sent from <hi>France,</hi> and one Regiment of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:37916:39"/>
               <hi>Dutch,</hi> and mostly Protestants, great care was taken to keep them from startling, and the whole <hi>Irish</hi> Army was composed of about 40000 men, besides 15000 that remained in Garrisons, and 6000 of the Militia, under the Command of Colonel <hi>Luttrel</hi> and <hi>Mac Gilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuddy,</hi> who was ordered as his Assistant in the Government of the City. And hereupon a hasty Order came out, that all who walked the Streets without Bayonets or Swords, should be seized. And thereupon a great many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, who could not get such Weapons, were taken up, and many of them Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And another Order, That upon pain of Death, not above five Protestants, besides the Family, should meet together: So that the Churches, which had till this time been kept open, were shut up, and Dr. <hi>King</hi> Dean of St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s imprisoned: Yet such was the Zeal of the Protestants in these dangerous times, that they gathered considerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions for the Maintenance of the dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest Clergy, and for such as were Prisoners, till they were forced to desist; all the Goals and many of the Churches, being crowded with Prisoners, not only Citizens, but such as had been brought from <hi>Galloway, Kilmainham,</hi> and other places; many of them were stifled by crowding and wanting of Air, and others almost famished for want of Sustenance. It would be too tedious to enumerate all the particular Sufferings of the Protestants, their frequent Allarms, Fears and many other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances. Therefore let it suffice, that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:37916:39"/> though sorrow lasted for a night, Joy came in the morning, as by the Sequel will be Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            <p>The two Armies being now in the Field, the <hi>Irish</hi> however declined fighting all they could; and it was given out, That King <hi>James</hi> designed to lead them about the Banks of the River <hi>Boyne</hi> to weary out the <hi>English,</hi> as thinking they could not pass that Stream, if defended on the other side; and after he had so done, to cross the Country and go for <hi>Limerick.</hi> However, least the <hi>English</hi> should push on, and give him Battel, he resolved to provide for the worst, and therefore ordered Sir <hi>Patrick Trant,</hi> the first Commissioner of his Revenue, to have shipping ready at <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> to carry him off, if things came to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; for at last he found, unless he aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned <hi>Dublin,</hi> which was proposed to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, he could not avoid fighting above ten days; for the King of <hi>England,</hi> impatient of delay, possessed himself of almost all the Passes and Posts that were advantageous to bring the Enemy to a Battel; and many Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes happened between Parties abroad, wherein our men gained the advantage.</p>
            <p>The Enemy by this time being Encamped near <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and strongly guarding a Pass, call'd <hi>Four-mile-Bridge,</hi> which was very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to force, it was resolved that our Army should march to <hi>Market-hill,</hi> and therefore to fall into the great Road that leads from <hi>Armagh</hi> to <hi>Dundalk;</hi> whereupon Major <hi>Scravenmore</hi> was sent out with a Detachment of 300 Horse
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37916:40"/> and 20 Dragoons, to view the Road and Passes, and find a convenient place to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp in, and discover, if possible, the posture of the Enemy; which was so well performed, that a small Party of theirs, seeing this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment betimes in the Morning marching towards <hi>Market-hill,</hi> supposed it to be the Vauntguard of the whole Army, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gave the Alarm to their Camp that our Army was almost upon them, which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sending to know the certainty, put them into such a fear, that they fired their Camp, and marched away; which being certified to the King, it appeared so strange, that it could not presently gain credit: But being in a short time confirmed from all hands, the order of the March was changed, and a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch sent to the Forces at <hi>Armagh</hi> and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nargee,</hi> that they should immediately march by the great Road towards <hi>Dundalk.</hi> But a Detachment of 200 Foot and 50 Dragoons going from the <hi>Newry</hi> towards <hi>Dundalk,</hi> were incompassed by an Ambush of 500 of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Horse; and though our Men fought desperately, yet above 20 of them were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and wounded, and the Enemy lost as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, with the Officer that commanded them, whose Horses our Men in their Retreat brought away with them.</p>
            <p>On the 31th of <hi>June</hi> the King marched ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Morning from his Camp at <hi>Ardee</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Drogheda,</hi> and found the <hi>Irish</hi> Army Encamped along the <hi>Boyne</hi> above the Town; but the Foot not coming up before it was late,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:37916:40"/> and with them the Artillery; nothing could be done that Night, but visiting the Posture of the Enemy, and the Fords of the River, which appeared very difficult to pass. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the King Encamped within shot of the Enemies Cannon, which had like to have proved very fatal to these Kingdoms, by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death so near a precious Life that is so dear to them; for as his Majesty was taking a view of their Posture, a six pound shot brushed his shoulder, and razed the skin, making a large though not a deep Wound; yet he nothing daunted thereat, only caused it to be dressed, and mounting again, kept on Horseback for several hours after; and toward the dusk of the Evening, he commanded Count <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> with the right Wing of the Horse, two Regiments of Dragoons, and <hi>Trelawney</hi>'s Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade, to take five Field-Pieces, and go early in the Morning to try the Fords some Miles above the Enemies Camp, and if he found an Opportunity to pass over and Attack them in the Flank, or oblige them to Decamp. And almost beyond expectation, he passed with good Success, beating off 8 Squadrons that stood ready to oppose him; and having gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firm ground on the other side the River, drew up his Men in Battalia, sending to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the King what he had done, and to receive his further Orders: But the King no sooner received the News, and perceived the Enemy were drawing up to Charge the right Wing, but he caused an Attack to be made in three places; the first before a small Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:37916:41"/> at a very good Ford; at the Second the Foot waded the middle; and at the Third the Horse were forced to swim. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Foot-Guards that first passed over, sustained the shock of the Enemies shot, whilst they were in the Water, not firing till they came up close, and then pouring in their Bullets. Those that were in the Village, and behind the Ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es gave way; but five of the Enemies Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions came up to charge them, before the Third Battalion of that Regiment had passed the River, yet ours maintained their ground, and made them retreat in disorder, leaving one of their Colours, and many dead men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place; but our men pressing eagerly on, and advancing beyond the Village, were twice vigorously attacked by the Enemies Horse, but received no great Damage; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Danish</hi> Forces advanced to the left, and the Brigadiers <hi>Melionere</hi> and <hi>Hanmore</hi> came on the Right, one being attacked by the Dragoons, and the other by the Horse, but neither did any great matter, by reason they had no Pikes. And now the thundering of the Guns, clashing of Swords, and the Cries and Shouts made a confused noise; so that the <hi>Irish</hi> trembled at the Din of War.</p>
            <p>Duke <hi>Schomberg</hi> having passed the River with a few Forces, at what time about thirty Officers, and others of the Enemies Life-Guard, had desperately charged the King's Battalion, and were all killed except Five, and those attempting to escape through the Village, unhappily met with the Duke, who
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:37916:41"/> in the Firings that were made, received a shot in the Neck, doubtful whether from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or accidentally from his own men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he fell from his Horse, and died without speaking in Arms of a <hi>French</hi> Captain, who alighted to relieve him, and as he had been trained up in War almost from his Youth, so now he ended his days in the Bed of Honour. He received in this Action likewise two Cuts over the Forehead, but not very considerable. And the famous Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> who held out the Siege of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> passing the River, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a shot in his Belly, of which he died soon after, much lamented of all that knew his Vertue and Courage.</p>
            <p>The King all this while discharging the part of a great General and a valiant Soldier, was every where at hand to give Orders, and succour those that stood in need, marching with Seventeen Battalions of Foot, and the Horse he had about him, to inforce those Troops that had engaged the Enemy, though they had not much advanced towards the Right Wing; which he did with Nine Squadrons of Horse, and Twelve Battalions of Foot, and so marched them against the Enemy; who upon their approach fled, without staying to be charged, retiring in much disorder; but our Horse pressed on to overtake them in such haste, that the Foot could not keep pace with them; they took with them likewise five small Field-pieces; and our Dragoons supported by the Horse, charged the Rear of the flying E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and killed a great many of them; so
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37916:42"/> that for the more speed they threw away their Arms, and what else was cumbersome; yet finding themselves hard pressed by so small a part of our Army, some of the <hi>French</hi> faced about, and made as if they would stand the Charge; but the King appearing on the Hills with his Troops, they fled faster than before, many of them scattering and making their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scapes through the Bogs and narrow Passes, our Foot pursued them but to <hi>Duleek,</hi> yet our Horse had the chase of them four Miles further, till Night came on, and then the King sent them Orders to return to the Foot, and sent for Tents and Baggage from his Camp at <hi>Drog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heda,</hi> that the weary Soldiers might repose themselves that Night.</p>
            <p>The greatest part of the Enemies Baggage fell into the hands of our Army, as their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, Tents, Arms, Cannon, Ammunition, Provision, and some Money; and what was more remarkable, a great many Arms were found laid down in Rank and File, those that owned them being run away, without so much as staying to Recover them. About Three thousand were slain, and divers Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Note taken, amongst whom was Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-General <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who deserted the King, the Trust he reposed in him; yet he was used very kindly, notwithstanding his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ingratitude: And upon this Defeat the strong Town of <hi>Drogheda</hi> surrendred, as did many other Places thereabout.</p>
            <p>The late King <hi>James,</hi> who had stood at a distance to view the Fight, as soon as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37916:42"/> his Army in Rout, fled with all speed towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> with a very few Attendants, where he immediately called a Council, and acquainted the Magistrates of the City with the misfortune that had befallen him, declaring never to trust himself more at the Head of an <hi>Irish</hi> Army, who would not stand a single Charge, and then told those about him, they must shift for themselves as he intended to do; but strictly commanded the Papists not to fire the City, saying, <hi>Though he left it, he did not quit his Claim to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Horse under Monsieur <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zun,</hi> having stood the hottest of the Fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst ours, were extreamly broken and shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; of between Five and Six thousand, there not remaining above Three thousand five hundred. King <hi>James</hi> having slept very ill upon his Loss, was the next Morning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed with the News that King <hi>William</hi> was on his way to <hi>Dublin;</hi> which put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such a fear, that accompanied with the Duke of <hi>Berwick,</hi> the Marquess of <hi>Powis,</hi> and some others, scarce giving himself time for Refreshment, he left the City, and hasted to <hi>Waterford,</hi> where a Ship lay ready to receive him, and neither slept nor eat till he got out to Sea, and stood away for <hi>France:</hi> where, it seems, he received no extraordinary welcome when the great Loss and Expence of Treasures was known.</p>
            <p>The Protestants that were Prisoners in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> having News of what had happened, got at liberty, and possessing themselves of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37916:43"/> Militia Arms, secured the City, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Limerick</hi> and <hi>Meath</hi> being there, got together the Gentry and chief Citizens, and formed a Committee to regulate and settle the Affairs, which in the hurry and confusion were put much out of frame and order, and pursuant thereto, they garrisoned the Castle, and secured the Stores for the King's use, send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to acquaint the King with what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and to intreat him to hasten thither, and quiet the Tumult and Disorder some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly People had raised. The King upon this Notice immediately sent thither a Troop of Dragoons, and the next day the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Overkirk</hi> were sent with Nine Troops of Horse, and joyfully received. Whereupon the Papists, especially such as had been over-active in oppressing the Protestants, got away with such things as they could carry either by Land or Water, as fearing to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to account for their Misdoings: so that they who had a little before tyrannized over the Protestants, found the Scene changed, and the Stream turned against them; some indeed the Rabble had seized, and prevented from Flight; but such was the Clemency of the King upon his coming to that City, most of them were not only set at liberty, but that the Kingdom might be quieted, he published his Declaration in these words:</p>

                           <p>AS it hath pleased Almighty GOD to bless Our Arms in this Kingdom with a late Victory over Our Enemies at the <hi>Boyne,</hi> and with the Possession of Our Capital City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and with a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dispersion of all that did oppose Us, We are now in so happy a prospect of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and of extinguishing the Rebellion of the Kingdom, that We hold it reasonable to think of Mercy, and to have Compassion upon those whom We judge to have been se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: wherefore we do hereby declare, We shall take into Our Royal Protection all La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, Common Soldiers, Country Farmers, Plough-men, and Cottiers whatsoever: As also Citizens, Towns-men, Trades-men, and Artificers, who either remain at home, or having fled from their Dwellings, shall by the first Day of <hi>August</hi> next repair to their usual Places of Abode, surrendring what Arms they have, to such Justices of the Peace as are, or shall be appointed by Us to Receive them, and Register such the said Appearance of such of the said Persons as shall come and render themselves to Our Authority: For Our Royal Intention is, and We do hereby declare, That We will not only Pardon all those poor seduced People, as to

            <p>Upon this offer of Pardon, a great many of the meaner sort of the <hi>Irish</hi> laid down their Arms, and complied with the Contents of the Declaration, some going home to their Habitations, and many of those that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of any, took the Service; and things began to carry a Face of Settlement, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully altered from what before it was: So that the People, who a little before were, as it were, in Slavery, and in danger of their Lives, now found themselves at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and utterly freed from those Fears that had so long afflicted them. And soon after his Majesty came to that City, and heard a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon at St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Church, preached by Dr. <hi>King,</hi> suffering only his Guards, and some of his great Officers, to enter the City with him, and went that day back to his Camp to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when he had given the Magistrates such necessary Orders as he thought conducing to the happiness of the place, and was Addressed by them, and by the Bishops and Clergy, wherein they expressed their abundant Joy and Gratitude for his Majesty's having been the Instrument, in the Hand of Heaven, for their great Deliverance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Town and Castle of <hi>Wexford</hi> being deserted by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, who fled amongst others to <hi>France,</hi> it declared for the King, and a Garrison was put into it.</p>
            <p>And now the main Strength of the <hi>Irish</hi> Army being broken by the last Defeat, the Popish Priests every where made it their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to stir up the Rabble and looser sort of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37916:45"/> People, who plundered and made great Spoil, especially in the Countries where the King's Forces were not at hand to quell them; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Militia frequently met with them, and many of their Ring-leaders being taken, were hanged up as Thieves and Robbers. And that the Counties might be the better settled and guarded, his Majesty made his Progress into divers of them, and appointed Sheriffs and other Officers, as he passed, conferring upon Count <hi>Menard,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Schemberg</hi>'s Son, in respect of the great Affection he bore his Father, the place of great Master of the Artillery, and soon reduced <hi>Wexford</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places. Yet the Enemy held by Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons many Towns of Strength, as <hi>Cork, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway, Athlone, Limerick,</hi> &amp;c. near to the last of which <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> and <hi>Lauzun</hi> had Rallied the broken Army, so that to dislodge them, the Siege of that Place was resolved on, though the Season began to advance apace towards the usual coming on of bad Weather in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The King having pretty well settled the Affairs of those Counties where his Army had passed, and those that put themselves under his Protection, took it into his Princely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, That his Subjects had, during this War, been very much imposed upon, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused by Moneys coined in the Enemies Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and by the Order of the late King, of no value, in competition of its Premium di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Exhibitors, for the Relief of such Abuse to the Subject, issued out his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation

            <p>By this we may see the great loss People of all qualities sustained, the Money being as we elsewhere have mentioned, ordered, upon great Penalties in case of refusal, to pass at the Values mentioned, though extraordinarily superiour to the value of the Metal, as appears by its being reduced to its intrinsick Value; yet little of this fell to the share of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, who in their Extremities thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves well to escape with their Lives, having no considerable opportunities to handle Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and therefore came off with as little loss in the Reducement of it.</p>
            <p>On the 19th of <hi>July</hi> the Royal Camp lying at <hi>Chappel-Izard,</hi> removed thence towards <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford,</hi> that still held out, whenas the King sent a Summons to the Town, requiring Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-Colonel <hi>Hevesey,</hi> Governour of the Place, immediately to Surrender, and that if he obeyed the Royal Mandate, the Garrison should be permitted to march out quietly, and the Citizens to enjoy their Houses, Goods and the Benefit of Trade; but upon Refusal to Expect no Quarter. 200 Horse, under the Command of Col. <hi>Comboon</hi> and Col. <hi>Matthews,</hi> went with the Trumpeter, who delivered his Message: But the Governour making divers extravagant Demands, which would have been answered with a sudden Attack, but that his Majesty had Compassion of about 300 Protestant Families in the Town, that must have suffered in the common Calamity; wherefore in singular Clemency, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the same Capitulation to be sent them which
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:37916:47"/> had been granted to <hi>Drogheda</hi> the day after the Battel of the <hi>Boyne,</hi> with this Addition, <hi>That the Garrison might depart each Man with his own Arms, but not with Drums beating and Colours flying;</hi> which, after some Debate, they thankfully accepted; and on the 25th of <hi>July</hi> marched out, to the number of about 1600 Men, being conducted to <hi>Mallow,</hi> a small Town, lying in the way to <hi>Lymerick;</hi> but some of their Officers stayed behind, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored his Majesty's Protection; when on the same day the King viewed the Walls of the Place, but entered not into the Town, and so returned back to the Camp, sending a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to Captain <hi>Michael Bourk,</hi> Governour of <hi>Duncannon</hi> Fort, offering the like Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that had been granted to <hi>Waterford,</hi> in case he immediately Surrendred, but upon Refusal to expect no Mercy. When instead of a positive Answer, he only desired six days to consult <hi>Tyrconnel;</hi> which being refused, he declared he would take that time. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cannon was commanded to be brought and planted against the Place, in order to a Battery. But on the 26th in the Evening, Sir <hi>Clously Shovel</hi> appearing with 16 Frigats, mounted with Guns of considerable Force, within shot of the Fort, it brought such a Terrour upon the Garrison, that the Governour wrote to Major-General <hi>Kirk,</hi> that he would accept of the Terms offered; which his Majesty being made acquainted with, he was pleased to order, That they should still have the benefit of the Articles that were at
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37916:48"/> first proposed; and the Fort accordingly was Surrendred. After which the King marched towards <hi>Dublin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During these Transactions, divers Parties were abroad, who hindered the scattered <hi>Irish</hi> from getting together, Reducing some Castles, Forts, and other advantageous For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses and Posts, to their Majesties Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>His Majesty now resolving, as is said, to besiege the strong Town of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate on the River <hi>Shannon,</hi> under the shelter of which the greatest part of the Enemies ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied Forces were retired, being about 25000 strong, Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Douglas,</hi> who had for some time blocked up <hi>Athlone,</hi> was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to draw off, and to joyn the Royal Army on its way. The Garrison was composed of a mixture of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Irish;</hi> they had va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Disputes about Surrendring that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Place upon honourable Terms; but at last were prevailed with by the Earl of <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connel</hi> to stand upon their Defence.</p>
            <p>Whilst the Army prepared to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Lymerick,</hi> and his Majesty to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at that Siege, had put off his intended passing over from <hi>England,</hi> 50 of our Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons approaching the Town of <hi>Youghall,</hi> the place surrendred: To bring it to which, the Contrivance was in this manner; The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison that marched from <hi>Waterford,</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by those Dragoons under the command of Captain <hi>Pownal</hi> to <hi>Youghall,</hi> who telling the Governour of the Place, who was the same
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37916:48"/> that Surrendered up <hi>Carickfergus</hi> the precedent Year, the certain Ruin he would bring upon himself, if he thought of holding out; and thereupon advising him to a Surrender: he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some further Debate, only desired him to expect his Answer till Ten at night, at which time he privately marched out with Three Companies of Foot, giving the Captain an unexpected possession of the Town, where he found 14 Guns mounted, and 2 without Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, 350 Barrels of Oats, 215 stone of Wooll, and several other sorts of Provisions, but neither Powder nor Ball.</p>
            <p>The King being thus far on his March, a Deserter came out of <hi>Lymerick</hi> to our Camp, and gave Information, <hi>That the</hi> French <hi>had marched out of the Town with eight Field-pieces, and took their way towards</hi> Galloway, <hi>there, if urgeney required it, to be ready for Imbarcation to</hi> France; <hi>and not only those in the Town were unsettled and discontented, and that others, displeased at</hi> Tyrconnel<hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, were retired to the Mountains of</hi> Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; <hi>and such Fear the Approach of our Army brought upon the Enemy, made them break down the Bridges to retard their March.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that hindered but little, for where they found them in that Condition, they forded the Rivers; and that the People might be still assured of his Majesty's Clemency towards them, another Declaration was published; and also that a Blessing might attend his Arms, a Fast was proclaimed to be observed through all the Provinces of the Kingdom under their
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:37916:49"/> Majesty's Obedience on the 15th of <hi>August,</hi> and to be observed constantly, during the War, on <hi>Friday</hi> in every Week; which was Religiously kept, as well out of a due sense of God's Mercies and Favours already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended towards the late languishing Kingdom, in a wonderful Deliverance, as what they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expected.</p>
            <p>The Approach of our Forces was no sooner known to <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> and <hi>Lauzun,</hi> but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired further into the Country, leaving Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Boisleau</hi> Governour in the Town, with a very good Garrison, and store of Provision, the <hi>French</hi> retiring under the Walls of <hi>Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi> but the Inhabitants not liking such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly Guest, who sought their Master's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest more than the welfare of <hi>Ireland,</hi> shut their Gates, and denied them Entrance. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at last being received into the Town at the Instance of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> and others, they shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Resentments by dealing very severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Inhabitants; and we had an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that they hanged up two of those that were most active in opposing their Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>The Army approaching <hi>Lymerick,</hi> found the Enemy strongly posted about a Mile from the Town, and that they had lined the Hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, from whence they fired upon our Men, but were soon dislodged, and obliged to fly to their Main-guard; and the <hi>English</hi> passed the River <hi>Shannon</hi> without any considerable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, the Enemy that guarded the further shoar flying at their approach, and for haste
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37916:49"/> left behind them several Tents and other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, and encamping within the reach of their great Guns, they raised Works to secure them from the shot, though some were killed by random Bullets. The Army was no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Encamped, and Entrenchers made some Advance, but the King sent to Summon the Governour to Surrender, withal, offering him very good Conditions, but he utterly refused it; returning answer, <hi>That he was resolved to defend the place to the last Extremity.</hi> Upon which the Trenches were opened, and the great Guns being on their way to the Camp, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Sarsfield,</hi> with a strong Party, taking a great Compass, set upon those that had them in Charge, and over-powering the Convoy, killed divers of the Waggoners, not sparing their Wives, with their Children in their Arms, burning some of the Waggons and Carriages of the Cannon, Nailing up part of the great Guns, and breaking others. But upon the approach of Captain <hi>Coningham</hi> with a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Inniskilling</hi>-men, they made a hasty Retreat; yet the Captain fell in with their Rear, killed some, took other Prisoners, and recovered a considerable Booty. So that these, and other great Guns, being brought to the Camp, <hi>Clonmel,</hi> a small Fort near <hi>Lymerick,</hi> Surrendred upon Discretion, and the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son made Prisoners of War. And now the Batteries being raised, the Cannons spoke <hi>English</hi> Language in Thunder against the Town, and the Trenches were Advanced within 300 Paces of the Wall, and two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:37916:50"/> taken, the which, and other Successes of the like nature, made them Advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another Redoubt. Whenas Colonel <hi>Douglas</hi> mounting the Guard, and the sign appointed given by firing 8 Guns for Attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, those that were Detached for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice being 150, besides Officers, fell on with extraordinary Bravery, and Entering the Fort, drove out the Enemy, killing about 40, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed themselves of it, though the Enemy from the Town made a vigorous Sally with Horse and Foot; and the new Batteries being level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against the high Towers, soon laid them in Rubbish; also the Bombs and Carkasses thrown in set a great many Houses on fire: So that under the favour of these Consterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Enemy were put unto, our Men made their Advances within Thirty Paces of the Ditch, and the Cannon still playing, not only widened the Breach, but beat down part of the Counterscarp and Palisado's; so that an Attack was made on the Counterscarp, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by a detached Party of Granadiers, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by other Detachments, who soon gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; as also a Fort the Enemy had under the Wall; but instead of lodging themselves as they were commanded, thinking Fortune was altogether now on their side, they pushed on to enter the Breach in pursuit of the <hi>Irish</hi> that ran thither, but the Cannon being turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them, charged with Cartridge-shot, the greater part of those that were Advanced were cut off, and some blown up by the springing of a Mine in the Ditch; so that by
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37916:50"/> computation 100 Men were killed and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet they came not off without leaving the Marks of their Valour upon the Enemy. But by this time, the Army having the Elements to contend with, as well as the Enemy, by reason of the stormy Winds and incessant Rains, which not only made the River over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow, but filled the Trenches knee-deep with Water, and would in a short time, in all probability, have cut off the Communication, and hindered the Forrage from coming in, his Majesty, upon mature deliberation, thought fit to raise the Siege, and refer it to a more seasonable opportunity. So that on the 30th of <hi>August</hi> the heavy Cannon and Baggage were sent away, and the next day the Army decamped and marched off in good Order, strong Detachments being sent towards <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Kingsale:</hi> And the King having appointed the Lord Viscount <hi>Sidney</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningsby</hi> Governours of the Kingdom, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the other Affairs, as advantageously as might be, sailed for <hi>England,</hi> and landed at <hi>Bristol,</hi> where, as in other places, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with a general Joy.</p>
            <p>Upon the King's departure, the <hi>Irish</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons thought themselves safe for the Winter at least, but found in a short time they were deceived, for other measures were taken. The <hi>English</hi> Fleet had orders to stand away to the Coast of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and soon arrived in <hi>Cork</hi> Harbour; and upon notice of their Arrival, the Land Forces drew down to joyn them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Landing.</p>
            <pb n="90" facs="tcp:37916:51"/>
            <p>Upon which the Duke of <hi>Berwick,</hi> who stiled himself Lord General of <hi>Ireland,</hi> drew off, <hi>Lauzun</hi> and <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gone to <hi>France.</hi> Lieutenant-General <hi>Douglas</hi> followed after the Duke with a strong Party, to fall upon his Rear, but he Encamped so advantagiously behind the Bogs, that it was not thought feasible to attempt the forcing his Camp.</p>
            <p>A Battery of 8 Guns was raised to hinder the Landing of our Men, but two or three armed Boats forcing ashoar those that were to manage and guard the Guns fled, and our men dismounted them, throwing the Carriages in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea; so that on the 24th of <hi>September,</hi> 5 or 6000 Seamen, Gunners, and Carpenters were detached to be employed in raising the Batteries and mounting the Cannon against the Town of <hi>Cork,</hi> and divers Boats of arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men were sent to assist the taking it by water; so that upon the approach of the Army, the Enemy set fire to the Suburbs, and the Earl of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> who commanded the King's Forces in chief, having taken a view of its Scituation, and finding the Enemy had quitted a Post called <hi>Cats-Fort,</hi> sent a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to take possession of it, and then advanced his Camp within Musquet shot of the South-side of the Town, which occasioned the Enemy to set fire to the Suburbs, for fear our Soldiers should lodge themselves in it; yet our Men advanced to the Ruins, and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Old Fort from two Batteries they had raised, and the next day made a Breach
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37916:51"/> in the Wall so wide, that the Besieged fearing our Men would Enter by Storm, and dreading the consequences of Delay, they beat a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and sent out an Officer to Capitulate, and Hostages were Exchanged; but the besieged standing high upon Terms, four Regiments under the Command of Brigadier <hi>Churchil,</hi> were ordered to get into the Island near the Wall, where the Breach was made, which they performed by fording it to the middle, the Granadiers, commanded by the Lord <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> leading the Van, being exposed to all the Fire of the Enemy: Amongst those that attempted this were a great many noble Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers, as the Duke of <hi>Grafton,</hi> the Lord <hi>O Brian,</hi> Colonel <hi>Granvil,</hi> Captain <hi>Leighton,</hi> Captain <hi>Cornwal,</hi> Captain <hi>Nevel,</hi> Captain <hi>Fairborn,</hi> and others; but it proved fatal to the Duke, for by a shot he received, he soon after died, and his Body being carried for <hi>England,</hi> was there honourably interred.</p>
            <p>The Besieged finding that our Men would not enter, as not being above 20 Paces from the Breach, beat another Parley, but could have no other Conditions than to be Prisoners of War; to which, with some difficulty, they agreed, and the Capitulation was signed, which in the Articles was to this purpose, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That upon the Garrisons being received as Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners of War, no prejudice should be done to the Officers, Soldiers, or Inhabitants, but that the General should make it his Endeavour to obtain
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37916:52"/> his Majesty's Mercy and Favour towards them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Old Fort should be delivered up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an hour, and the two Gates the like, by</hi> 8 <hi>in the Morning the next day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That all the Arms of the Garrison and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants should be put into secure places, and the Protestant Prisoners immediately released.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That a due Account should be given of the Magazines, as well of Provision as Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the same Night 200 Men took posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Old Fort, and the next Morning of the Town; the Garrison, between 4 and 5000 being made Prisoners of War; and of note amongst them were the Earls of <hi>Clancar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Tyrone,</hi> Colonel <hi>Macgillicot</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and divers others.</p>
            <p>This place thus taken and put into trusty hands, the Army immediately marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Kingsale,</hi> and took their Posts about the New Fort, whilst Major-General <hi>Teteau</hi> was Commanded with 800 Men to make an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack upon the Old Fort; whereupon passing the River in Boats, he on the 3d of <hi>October,</hi> gave an Assault, and Entered it by Storm, making at the same time, to divert the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, a false Attaque; and our Men at one and the same time giving the Bastions, some Barrels of Powder took fire, and destroyed about 50 of the Enemy, and in the heat of Fury many were killed. Those that Escaped, some fled unto the Old Castle in the midst of the Fort, and some endeavouring the New Fort, by the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:37916:52"/> help of a Boat, the Tide being against them, they were mostly killed by the shot of our Men from the shoar, the Governour and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Officers were killed in defending the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, and found dead in the places where they fell, and the Soldiers got considerable Plunder.</p>
            <p>The Old Fort thus Entirely won, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sent a Summons to the New Fort to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand its immediate Surrender; but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur sent back word, <hi>That it would be time enough to talk of that a Month after.</hi> But the General, not to be dallied, caused the heavy Cannon to be mounted, and two Attacks were ordered to be made by the <hi>English</hi> on the right, and the <hi>Danes</hi> on the left; and the more to amuse the Enemy, a false Attack was made, and on the 15th of <hi>October</hi> the Cannon played all the Morning, and the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries were preparing to lay over the Ditch, when about One of the Clock the Enemy beat a Parly, proposing that Hostages might be Exchanged in order to a Treaty; which done, Articles were agreed on, and signed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Midnight; and pursuant thereto the middle Bastion was to be delivered up the next Morning, and about 1200 men, of which the Garrison consisted, were to march out the day after. And the principal of the Prisoners taken here, and at <hi>Cork,</hi> were ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for <hi>England;</hi> but some of them met with a sad Disaster on the Coast; for being put on Board the <hi>Breda,</hi> by what means is uncertain, her Powder taking fire, she blew up, and most
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:37916:53"/> of those who were on Board were desteoyed; the rest of the Fleet returned in Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Irish</hi> that yet kept the Field, were not above 10000, yet they promised themselves great Recruits against the Spring.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the Protestants concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved great Joy at this Success, and in a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Acknowledgment to his Majesty, who had been so signally instrumental in the Hand of Heaven for their Deliverance, his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day being the Fourth of <hi>November,</hi> Old stile, was observed in the reduced Places in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner, but especially at <hi>Dublin,</hi> where the Militia, consisting of 2500 Foot, and two Troops of Horse, and as many of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, were drawn out, and gave several Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; and in the Evening there was very fine Fireworks before the Lords Justices House on <hi>Colledge-Green,</hi> and by their Order Claret was distributed to the People, who drank their Majesty's Healths with all the Expressions of Duty and Loyalty; and most of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Gentry in and about the City, were invited by the Lords Justices to a splendid Entertainment and Banquet, the Day conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with ringing of Bells, and the Night with Bonefires and Illuminations, as also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Publick Demonstrations of Joy and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>
            <p>The Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> being the Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary of the Popish Powder-Plot, the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices attended by the Nobility, Judges, and other Persons of Quality in the Town, with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:37916:53"/> the King and Herauld at Arms, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of Honour carried before them, went to St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Church, and after their Return the Lords Justices gave the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try another splendid Entertainment, their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Titles being at the second Course pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in <hi>Latin, French,</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> by the King at Arms, the great Guns in the Castle continually thundring the general Joy in their roaring Language. And that the Common People might not be wanting in sharing of their Bounty, a whole Ox, and an Hogshead of strong Bear was dealt out amongst them, and at Night the general Joy was concluded with Bonefires, and other Demonstrations of Publick Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>The Soldiers being now mostly in their Winter-Quarters, that they might have good usage, and the Inhabitants of those Towns where they were quartered at the same time receive no damage, the Lords Justices thought it necessary to give their Orders concerning those Matters, and accordingly issued out their Proclamation for regulating the Quarters of the Army, and ascertaining the Rates to be allowed for the Soldiers Diet, the Prizes of Provisions, and the manner how the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants that trusted them should be paid for what they delivered out to them.</p>
            <p>The Rapparies having already been fairly warned to desist from their Ravages, and Burnings in the Countries under Obedience; they notwithstanding enterprizing the like, Captain <hi>Archer</hi> upon Notice that a Party of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:37916:54"/> them were abroad, marched against them with about Twenty of the Militia; but upon his approach finding them much stronger than he had been informed, after a hot dispute he found himself obliged to retire with the loss of four of his Men; however, not giving it over, he immediately raised more of the Militia, and the next Morning by break of day fell upon them a second time with better success for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put them to rout, he killed about Twelve of them, and took Twenty Prisoners, enriching his Men with such Booty as those People had scraped together, in those Countries where they had been for a considerable time doing much mischief.</p>
            <p>And now the Lords Justices and Councel having reason to suspect, that several dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Persons coming to the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> as Spies from the Enemies Quarters, and upon other wicked Designs, were sheltered in that City by Papists, Natives, who kept Taverns, and other Publick Houses, and there frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly met to continue as much as in them lay, the Subversion of Their Majesties Government, and the Ruin of their good Subjects of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> thought fit to put out their Proclamation, to prohibit and forbid all Papists, Natives of the Kingdom, to sell any Wine, Beer, Ale, or other Liquors by Retail, after the 25th of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1690. upon pain of being proceeded against as Retailers of Wine and other Liquors without License.</p>
            <pb n="97" facs="tcp:37916:54"/>
            <p>By this time one <hi>Mac Finnan</hi> having got together about Four hundred Men, being a mixture of the <hi>Irish</hi> Army and Rapporees, marched towards <hi>Castle-town,</hi> to surprize thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Dragoons, commanded by a Lieutenant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached thither from their Quarters at <hi>Iniskeen,</hi> and although they had all the advantage they could wish, yet the Lieutenant and his Men behaved themselves so bravely, that they kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Ten of their Enemies, but having spent their Ammunition, and five of their own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being killed, they found themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to Surrender, and had Quarter given them, yet the Lieutenant, his Serjeant, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his Men were put to the Sword in cold blood: however the Alarm reaching <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skeen,</hi> Major <hi>Culleford,</hi> who commanded there, Advanced with another detached Party, and falling upon them in the height of their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, put them to the rout killing about 12 on the place, took 5 Prisoners, without the loss of a Man on our side.</p>
            <p>Nor were the Commanders his Majesty had intrusted less watchful on all parts; for Major-General <hi>Tettau</hi> marching from <hi>Cork</hi> to <hi>Killcreagh,</hi> and on his way being joyned by others, so that he made up a Body of 2200 Men, he entred the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> where the Enemies Troops retired before him, and coming into a Fortification at <hi>Scrovolard,</hi> he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked it, and in two hours took it with little difficulty; when advancing along the edge of the Mountains, and sustaining the Rapparees fire, without receiving any considerable da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:37916:55"/> they discovered towards <hi>Brewster</hi> field, some of the Enemies Scouts, whereupon 70 of our Dragoons and Horse having the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, came up with a Party of 160 of the Enemies Horse, who not enduring the Fire of our Men, upon the first Charge retreated, and falling by degrees into confusion, at last came to plain running, though there were several <hi>Irish</hi> Nobility, and some considerable Officers amongst them; yet such as our Men had not yet attacked, put, by this time, the Country round about in a flame, and our Forces not being far from <hi>Killarny,</hi> hasted thither with all the speed they could to sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e that place; and notwithstanding the Enemy upon their approach left it, yet about twenty Cabbins were burnt by two Troopers that stayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind for that purpose, who as a Reward of their Undertaking, were killed by our Men, and <hi>Brewster</hi>'s Forge saved, and put divers of the Enemies Parties, then abroad, to the rout, clearing the Country in a manner on that side, whilst the <hi>Irish</hi> only bore up the little Courage they had left, relying much upon the further Aid they expected from <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, though the Season was far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, our Men gave it not over as yet, but for the better securing Winter-Quarters, and preventing the Country from Plunder, they took in several Castles, as the Castles of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Rea,</hi> into which <hi>Baldorick Mac Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> had put a Garrison of 100 Men, confining by this means the <hi>Irish</hi> that were in Arms to the Province of <hi>Ʋlster;</hi> whereupon the gross
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:37916:55"/> of our Army went into Winter-Quarters, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving some flying Parties abroad to keep under the Rapparees, who thought it now their time to rob and steal; and indeed they not only burnt the Lord <hi>Orrery</hi>'s House at <hi>Charleville,</hi> but committed many other Outrages, though divers of them came short home; for this kind of Black-Guard not being looked upon to be Soldiers, plundering sometimes as well the Papists as the Protestants, were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut off in their Attempts; and now when Force began to fail, the Enemy had recourse to Stratagems; but in this they failed, by a timely discovery, by Letters that were dropt by some Persons as they were flying to the Woods or Mountains; one of them written by one Mr. <hi>Hogen,</hi> who had been a Colonel in the <hi>Irish</hi> Army, acquainting him, <hi>That the Protestants were secure and supine in their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and that her Friends had lately done seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral strange Feats in the places that were under the</hi> English <hi>Obedience, and especially in the County of</hi> Wicklow, <hi>and that the</hi> French <hi>in the Kingdom were very industrious to take all advantages; that</hi> Tyrconnel <hi>would soon return with Forces from</hi> France; <hi>that the Soldiers in</hi> Dublin <hi>were poor and miserable, and would do any thing for Bread; so that if</hi> Sarsfield <hi>had a mind to come over the</hi> Shannon <hi>with his Forces, not only the Army, but the Militia would be drawn out of the City, and then every Papist fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his own House or Lodging, whilst the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation lasted, they might destroy the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants and secure the City, and that which had
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:37916:56"/> hitherto hindered them from putting the Project in Execution, was the Records of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom being there, which must needs perish in the flames; but however, they had at last remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that Scruple, and were resolved to go on with it, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>This Woman was taken and brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Privy Council, where she was so far from denying it, that she with confidence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed she writ it; and though she could not be blamed for doing what she had done, upon which she was committed to Prison. The Lords Justices upon this Discovery put out a severe Proclamation against the Papists, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them from putting such wicked Designs in practice, by banishing some for several miles, and taking strict Recognizance of the rest; which according to its true Tenor, for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the Curious in so weighty a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning the Safety of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, will not be amiss to be inserted.</p>

            <p>This, and the diligent search made after su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected Persons, startled the Caballars and Conspirators in such a manner, that they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dispersed or concealed themselves. So th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> pernicious Design of laying the Metropolis of <hi>Ireland</hi> in Ashes, and mixing those Ashes with the Blood of its Inhabitants, was frustrated. And indeed this appeared not to be grounded upon light Suspition, but upon substantial Reason; for the Enemies Troops abroad were about that time moving nearer towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> then any other Occasion but such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:37916:58"/> or Correspondence could reasonably require, but upon this discovery retired, and the City Guards were augmented, and all manner of Caution and Circumspection used that might prevent, in any probability, the threatned Danger.</p>
            <p>During these Transactions, those Troops we had abroad were not idle, but often marching many Miles into the Enemies Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, not only beat them from their Posts, and killed a great many of them; but gave the Villages opportunity to rest in quiet under their Majesties Protection, and freeing them from those Ravagements wherewith before they were distressed; so that many, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore stood out for fear of being plundered or destroyed, came in, and joyfully laid hold of the gracious Pardon offered them; so that the face of things seemed to put on a Calm, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Tempest that a little before had in a manner disjointed and put them out of Frame.</p>
            <p>The Enemies Regular Troops missing of the Advantages they expected, now gave way to the Outrages of the Rapperees more than ever, having before a little restrained their Insolencies, that the Advantage of Plunder might accrue to themselves; so that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many barbarous Murthers in Villages and Loan-houses, where their Force prevailed, being mainly incited thereto by the revengeful Priests, who shared with them in their Booty which made our Troops, though the Season was very incommodious for marching, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:37916:58"/> of the rains and quagginess of the ground, and incroach upon them, and frequently sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them in their Randezvous, beating them out of their Cabins, and firing them over their Ears.</p>
            <p>And now his Majesty providing for the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Affairs, the Privy Council were, the Lord Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Lord Chancellour, High Treasurer, and Archbishop of <hi>Dublin</hi> for the time being, the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Earls of <hi>Meath, Drogheda, Longhford, Ranelagh, Granard,</hi> and Viscount <hi>Lisburn,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Meath,</hi> the Vice-Treasurer, the Chancellor of the <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,</hi> the Chief Justices of the <hi>King's Bench, Common Pleas,</hi> Chief Baron of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> Master of the Rolls, Principal Secretary of State, and Master of the Ordnance for the time being, <hi>Robert Fitz-Gerrard,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> and <hi>William Hill</hi> Esquires.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Nor was the Civil Settlement alone consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, but likewise the Ecclesiastical Promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the good and tranquility of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Churches of <hi>Ireland; viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>March</hi> Bishop of <hi>Feras,</hi> was advanced to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishoprick of <hi>Cashel,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tenison</hi> Bishop of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lala,</hi> to be Bishop of <hi>Cloglier,</hi> Dr. <hi>William King</hi> to be Bishop of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> Dr. <hi>Digby</hi> Bishop
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:37916:59"/> of <hi>Lymirick</hi> to be Bishop of <hi>Elphin,</hi> Dr. Vigors Dean of <hi>Armagh,</hi> to be Bishop of <hi>Ferus,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wilson</hi> Dean of <hi>Rapho,</hi> to be Bishop of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fitz-Gerrald</hi> Dean of <hi>Cloim,</hi> to be Bishop of <hi>Cloufort,</hi> Dr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> Dean of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chonry,</hi> to be Bishop of <hi>Killala.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that now the face of things began to look pleasant; however, though it was in the dead of Winter, our Troops abroad found some A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for one of our advanced Parties, setting upon the Enemy near <hi>Castle-Town,</hi> they killed 22 of them, and took 5 Prisoners, and Colonel <hi>Foulks</hi> gave a considerable Defeat to about 1500 Rapperees and trained Soldiers, killing many of them, and taking some Prisoners near the Bogg of <hi>Allen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst these Successes were carried on with a high hand, Colonel <hi>Brewer</hi> possessed himself of the Forts and Town of <hi>Lansborough,</hi> and defeated about 3000 of the Enemy. Soon after Major-General <hi>Tetteau,</hi> heightned with his frequent Success, and the beating some small Parties of the Enemy, he marched his Forces towards the strong Town of <hi>Ross,</hi> which had in it a Carrison of 600 Men, under the Command of Colonel <hi>Maccarty,</hi> the Lords <hi>Coursey</hi> and <hi>Slane,</hi> and others of Note were also in the place, upon the approach of our Men, but not thinking themselves secure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, they poasted away for <hi>Lymerick,</hi> and thereupon our Approaches being made, 50 <hi>Danes,</hi> and 50 of the Detachment out of <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sale,</hi> were ordered to storm a Fort cut out of a Rock, which they did with so great a Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:37916:59"/> that they froze the Enemies Courage, and soon made themselves Masters of it, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting most they found therein to the Sword, and many of those that endeavoured to swim from thence to another Rock, were killed in the Water; and marching thence to <hi>Tralee,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Sheldon</hi> abandoned it with such speed, that they had no time to set it on fire, and so it fell entire into our hands; and we having a small Fort at <hi>Fermoy-Bridge</hi> in the County of <hi>Cork,</hi> the Enemy advanced with about 2000 Horse and Foot, under the Command of one <hi>Carrol,</hi> who upon his Approach sent to have it Surrendred, Declaring that he knew the strength of the Place, and that it was not tenable. But upon his approach found such a warm Reception, that after divers firings, he being kill'd upon the place, his Men took, to their heels, and that they might glory of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, they burnt one House in their return.</p>
            <p>Soon after this Defeat, and the routing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Parties of the Rapparees, Colonel <hi>Brewer</hi> and Major <hi>Board</hi> went out with a detached Party of 150 Horse, and about 200 Foot from <hi>Mullengar,</hi> to relieve <hi>Marescourt</hi> and <hi>Mayvore</hi> with Provision; and that done, they took their way towards <hi>Ballymore,</hi> and dislodged the Enemy on those Passes, opening and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Country, and then returned to their Stations, without the loss of any Men; and soon after this Lieutenant <hi>Taylor</hi> defeated 400 of the <hi>Irish</hi> near <hi>Endery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lieutenant-General <hi>Ginkle,</hi> upon notice that a great Body of the Enemy was gathering, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:37916:60"/> some of them advancing towards <hi>Athlone,</hi> he and Sir <hi>John Lanier</hi> drew out a Party to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them; who, upon their approach, retired in great confusion, but being pursued by our Horse and Foot, they were beat from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments they had made, as their last Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge; and the Chace being continued, about 200 of them were killed and wounded, and several taken Prisoners, and our Men got a great Booty of Horses; for the Enemy in their flight, being hard pressed in the Rear, quitted them, and got into the Woods.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Hamilton</hi> being abroad, meeting with a Party of the Enemy as they were Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaging the Country, near a place called <hi>Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi> set upon them, and at the first Charge put them into Disorder, and soon after to open flight, killing about 70 of them, and taking some Prisoners with Booty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Captain <hi>Derby</hi> defeated another Party of them at <hi>Birre.</hi> And now the Rapparees being more terrible to the Country People than the Enemies Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Forces, a Party was sent out to suppress them; so that being frequently met withal, a great many of them were killed, and some that were taken Prisoners were Executed; and lighting on a Party of about 400 <hi>Irish,</hi> though he had then 100 Foot, and 34 Horse, having lessened his number by Detachments, sent to find out the Rapparees; he however drew up, and Charged them with such Bravery, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Action some more of his Men coming in, he put them utterly to the Rout, killed and took Prisoners most of their Officers, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:37916:60"/> a great Booty. And indeed the Winter, not fit for the motion of great Bodies, was spent in the piquering of Parties, and settling the Civil, as well as Military Affairs of the Kingdom, and so continued till his Majesty went to Head the Confederate Army in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sarsfield</hi> having a great Command among the <hi>Irish,</hi> many of the Enemies chief Officers being gone for <hi>France,</hi> under pretence of bringing fresh Recruits early in the Spring, he drew together part of the shattered Army, and some of the Militia, at <hi>Knockany,</hi> with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to attack some of our Troops that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageously posted; but was so warmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that he found his Attempts very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous to himself, and thereupon pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most serviceable Men out of the Militia Troops, sent them to joyn the Forces he had ordered to encamp in the Province of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught,</hi> and put some of his Troops into Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison and Winter-Quarters.</p>
            <p>Notice being given to Lieutenant <hi>Spencer,</hi> that a hundred Men of the Enemies Troops were advanced within a Mile of <hi>Copperquin</hi> in the County of <hi>Waterford,</hi> with a design to surprize and carry off the Recruit Horses sent from <hi>England,</hi> for Brigadier's Regiment, he immediately marched with a Cornet and 12 Troopers, most of his Men being gone a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging, and finding the Enemy in some disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Charged them with his small Party, and pressed them so hard, that they retired into a Wood within a Mile of the place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:37916:61"/> 18 more of his Men coming up, part of them dismounted, entering the Wood, whilst the rest on Horseback secured the Pass, the Dispute lasted without firing on both sides for several hours, in which they killed 40 of the Enemy, and took the Captain that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, with 7 Soldiers Prisoners, also their Arms and Accoutrements, only one of the Lieutenant's Party being killed, and two or three wounded.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant <hi>Purcel</hi> being abroad with a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, fell in with the Rapparees, and in several Encounters with them killed about 100, but attempting to burn their Cabbins in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Longford,</hi> was way-laid by Sir <hi>Daniel O Neal</hi>'s Regiment of Dragoons, part on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and part on Foot; but 35 of the Royal Regiment of Dragoons, broke their whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy upon a furious Charge, killing 10 of them, and taking 4 Prisoners, with a Lieutenant, and pursued the rest to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> a Garrison they held in those parts, yet in the hasty flight ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them quitted their Horses, and took to the Bogs, where some were lost: These Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses were followed with others no less advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to us, and unfortunate to the Enemy; for Colonel <hi>Lillingstone</hi> being gone from <hi>Ros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:37916:61"/> Booty of 300 Head of Cattel, with the loss of 2 Soldiers and a Trooper's Horse, the manner of the Attack being thus:</p>
            <p>The Colonel detached 18 Horse, and as many Foot, and having them on Garrans, or <hi>Irish</hi> Horse, made all the haste he could to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Bridge of <hi>Nenagh,</hi> about half a Mile from the Town, whereupon the whole Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son came out to make opposition; but he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Pass till his Foot came up, and then leaving them at the Bridge, he advanced with his Horse towards the Enemy, who made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny firings, but so soon as our Men came near, began to retreat, and by degrees disordering themselves, fell to running, but being hotly pursued, about 20 of them were killed, and a Cornet taken Prisoner; after which he sent a Detachment to secure the Pass on the other side of the Town towards <hi>Lymerick,</hi> whilst the rest of his Men entred with the flying Enemy; however, many of them got into the Castle, but our Men burnt the Town, and got considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Plunder.</p>
            <p>And now open Force failing the Enemy, they betook them to cruel Stratagems; for a part of Colonel <hi>Foulk</hi>'s Regiment being in their Quarters, near <hi>Yaughal,</hi> about 8 of them were set upon in a private House, and murthered by surprize in a most despiteful manner, the like treatment being supposed to be intended to all the rest, had not this timely alarm'd them to stand to their Arms, and defend themselves.

            <q>
               <p>THat whereas by Examination of divers persons, it does appear that a Romish Priest, calling himself Father <hi>Christopher Brown,</hi> who has lived many Months in several places within his Majesties Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and Power, without being molested on account of his Orders or Religion, has been, if not the first Contriver and principal Director and Counsellor, yet a main Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Encourager of the late barbarous Murthers of Their Majesties Soldiers near this City; and whereas several others have been found to have been guilty of the said Murthers, who are fled from Justice, their Lordships do promise a Reward of Five

            </q>
            <p>This proceeding stopped the Issue of Blood that way, and rendred the Soldiers more secure in their Quarters and other Places where they came, the <hi>Irish,</hi> for fear of being taken notice of, giving them every where, in the places sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Their Majesties, better Usage.</p>
            <p>About the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> Lieutenant-General <hi>Ginkle</hi> came from <hi>Kilkenny</hi> to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and many of the General Officers, to consult with the Lords Justices about the Affairs of the Campaign, and concert Matters advantageous to their Majesties Service; and the <hi>Monmouth</hi> Yatch arrived with Money to that purpose, as likewise several Ships with Recruits of Horse and Foot. So that the Train of Artillery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this time drawn out, the Soldiers began to draw from their Winter-Quarters nearer <hi>Dublin,</hi> and Waggons and Carriages were provided on all hands, and Parties were sent out to remove the Enemies Posts, that the Spring being come, the Forage might not be wastfully destroyed.</p>
            <p>Some of Captain <hi>Green</hi>'s Militia Dragoons, marching into the Enemies Quarters, killed divers of the Rapparees, and set fire to the place that harboured them: And Quarter-Master
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:37916:64"/>
               <hi>Chalagan</hi> with a Party, beat the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Party abroad, took divers Prisoners, and some of note, with a considerable Booty; and by lying in the Marish Fields, a great many of the Enemies best Horse died, and their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision grew very scanty, which occasioned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to desert, some going to their Habitations, and others coming over to us, where such as were able were received.</p>
            <p>About the middle of <hi>April,</hi> 1691. one Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Fitz-Gerald,</hi> of the Enemies Party, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out with about 700 Men of the standing Troops, to attack a strong Stone-house called <hi>Croghan,</hi> near <hi>Philips-Town,</hi> which although it was guarded only by a Corporal and 8 or 9 Soldiers, made a resolute Defence, killing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 12 of the Enemy, and had done them greater damage, had not their Powder failed, at what time they were constrained to Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate, and give up the place. However, we were not long behind-hand with them, for on the Fourth of the next Month a small Party of our Troops was marched by Major <hi>Wood,</hi> from <hi>Mountmelick</hi> to <hi>Castle-Cuff,</hi> with 300 Foot, being Detachments of Colonel <hi>Lloyd</hi>'s and the Lord <hi>George Hamilton</hi>'s Regiments, and 50 Horse of Colonel <hi>Bierly</hi>'s, and dividing his Foot into several Parties, in order to surprize the Rapparees in the Bogs and Woods, and with his Horse kept along the skirts of the Bogs, to hinder their getting off, by which means about 70 of them were killed, and a Booty recovered, which he sent away, and a Guard of 30 Men, and in the mean while, with 30 Foot and 34
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:37916:64"/> Horse, beyond the <hi>Toger</hi> of <hi>Mallyhone,</hi> when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Ten in the Morning he discovered two Bodies of Men of the Enemies Army, each a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 400, marching silently between the Woods and the Mountains, but when they found our Men had espied them, they beat up their Drums.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Major drew up his Horse and Foot in a ploughed Field, and bid them Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; so that the Enemies Granadiers, thinking that our Men, discouraged at their number, would have run, came over the Hedge, but finding they stood firm to expect them, they stood, not advancing any further: In the mean while, a Detachment of the Enemy charged those Men on the side of the Wood that were sent away with the Booty; whereupon the Major wheeled off by the Skirts of the Wood, to succour them, who defended themselves by firing very briskly on the Enemy, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Lieutenant <hi>Ellis,</hi> and having got the Horse and Foot over the Bog, 80 more of his Men came to him, and thereupon he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Foot to march in two Divisions on each side the River, he marching between them with the Horse, when being advanced some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what near the Enemy, and thinking the Horse might do most Service, in taking a Compass about, and falling on the Rear, wheeled about with an Intention to Surround them, which they perceiving, and at the same time being pressed very hardly by the Foot, began to make an orderly Retreat; which the Major percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, broke in upon their Flank with the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:37916:65"/> Horse, which put them to rout and disorder, and soon after to open flight, whilst our Horse and Foot pursued them through the Woods, and down to the Bogs, killing about 150, and among them Captain <hi>Charles,</hi> and 2 Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, taking Prisoners Major <hi>John Fitz-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick,</hi> who commanded them, and 5 Captains, 9 Lieutenants, and 2 Ensigns, belonging to the several Regiments of Colonel <hi>Butler,</hi> Colonel <hi>Robert Grace,</hi> Colonel <hi>Luttrels</hi> Dragoons, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Moor,</hi> and Sir <hi>Maurice Eustace,</hi> and about 150 private Soldiers, among which were 6 Serjeants, 17 Corporals, an Adjutant-Major, a Chyrurgeon, 3 Drums, and about 150 Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets. Which Victory is to be accounted the more brave and great, because the Courage and Resolution of our Men carried it against such odds, we having only a Corporal killed, and Adjutant <hi>Robinson,</hi> with two Foot Soldiers and a Trooper wounded.</p>
            <p>Nor was this all the Success about this time, for 110 Foot, commanded by Captain <hi>Clayton,</hi> being sent for from <hi>Cork</hi> to relieve the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Ballymaggooly;</hi> they were in their march observed by a considerable Body of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horse, but they durst not Attack them; yet those that were relieved, marched out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Twelve in the Evening, commanded by Captain <hi>Thorncroft</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Hays;</hi> and about break of Day they were discovered by about 300 of the Enemies Horse and and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, who it was thought say in wait for them; as also a considerable number of Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parees: and our Men being all Foot, thought
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:37916:65"/> not the open Fields secure against the Horse, but for their better Defence, drew into an old Pound, having a Wall about it Breast-high; when by this time the Enemies advance Party coming up offered them Quarter; but they answered only by the firing of their Musquets; however, all the Enemies Troops being come up, they made many Attacks upon our Men, to force them from their Strength, yet they sustained their firings with little hurt; but in returning it, killed a great many of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who were commanded by Brigadier <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol</hi> and Sir <hi>James Cotton,</hi> which so discouraged them, that after they had offered our Men Quarter upon Surrendring, and it was refused, that they marched off, carrying away the wounded and most noted of those that were killed; yet they left behind them 3 Captains and 10 Troopers slain, and Major <hi>Slingsby</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately wounded, which they thought were too near our shot to be carried off; and in all they had between 40 and 50 killed and wounded, and of ours 10 were killed, and 5 wounded, and Major <hi>Slingsby</hi> was carried Prisoner to <hi>Cork.</hi> And much about this time one <hi>Walter Brown,</hi> who had been High-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable of the Barrony of <hi>Delwin,</hi> being taken as a Spy, was Executed, and Captain <hi>Pallasor,</hi> being abroad with a Party of our Men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of about 40 Firelocks of the Army, and 20 of the Militia, was by the subtil Insinuation and Treachery of one <hi>Terence Megral,</hi> drawn into an Ambush of two of the Enemies Regiments of Foot, and some Troops of Horse,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:37916:66"/> which in that Exigency made him betake to the Ruins of an old Castle, where he caused his Men to fortifie and defend themselves, which they did, continually firing upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, till all their Powder was spent, and then prayed for Quarter; and having it grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, they were carried Prisoners to <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now great Stores coming daily from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and a Recruit for our Army every day expected. The time for Action drawing near, the Lords Justices (that nothing might be wanting that was conducing to Their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Service) caused their Proclamation to be published for the Armies better Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Substance being in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>viz.</hi>

And that the Forces may be more plentifully supplied, and and those unnecessary Persons prevented from following the Camp, who are only an Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to it; and it being found by experience, that the Country has suffered extreamly by them, they have not only robbed and plundered it themselves, but have inticed the Soldiers to do the same; for the preventing of it for the future, and that the Quarters may be the better secured, whilst the Army is in the field, from Rapparees and other disaffected People, the Lords Justices do hereby order and direct all their Majesties Protestant Subjects, as well as Papists, to stay at, or repair to their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:37916:67"/> Habitations, for the preservation and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the same, and that no person or persons whatsoever, except such as come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Provisions for the use of the Army, or upon some lawful occasion approved of by the Commanders in chief, do follow the Camp upon pain of Death.</p>
            </q>
            <p>And that the People whom this War had scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into divers places, leaving many destitute of Habitations, might again be settled, another Proclamation was issued out to this effect;</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>That all the Inhabitants of the Counties of</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford <hi>and</hi> Tipperary, <hi>do retire within Three days to their respective Houses or Habitations, or to some adjacent Garrison, if they could not go home with security.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And those belonging to the Counties of</hi> Cork, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meriek <hi>and</hi> Kerry, <hi>are forthwith to repair either to their own Houses or Habitations, if they have any, or else to some of the Garrisons there, to be employed in the Militia for the defence of the Country when the Army is in the field, according to such further Orders as shall be given them for the Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi>

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:37916:67"/> from the Lords Justices, or himself in writing. And whereas that the Militia being to be in Arms for the Defence of the Country, whilst the Army remained in the field, no Person should press any Horse actually listed in the said Militia, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any pretence whatsoever.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>About this time some other Transport ships arrived from <hi>England,</hi> and brought a great quantity of all sorts of Military Provisions, and about Twenty thousand Arms, also Ordinance and Stores; whilst the Enemies great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the like supply from <hi>France</hi> failed them in great measure, that King seeming now to grow weary of a War that proved so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive to him without profit, and expecting to be sharply pressed this Summer in <hi>Flanders,</hi> by the Confederate Army, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the King of <hi>England,</hi> sent indeed some Officers, and a few Clothes, and such like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but seemed frugal in husbanding his Troops for a shelter from a Storm he expected nearer home; which did not a little discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the <hi>Irish,</hi> and made them again to desert in numbers: and their falling off had been greater, had not their Priests taken them to task, and insinuated how meritorious it was to fight with and destroy Hereticks.</p>
            <p>While these things passed, Captain <hi>White</hi> of the Lord <hi>George Hamilton</hi>'s Regiment, detach'd a hundred Men under the Command of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Johnston,</hi> who marched to <hi>Belnamona</hi> in <hi>Kings County,</hi> and surprized by break of day two Troops of Dragoons of Brigadier <hi>Clifford</hi>'s,

            <p>The Governour of <hi>Clonmel</hi> marching from that place with a Detachment of Horse, and two Troops of the Militia Dragoons came by Night into the Enemies Quarters, towards <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael's Town;</hi> but not finding them there, the Rapparees upon his Return fired out of the Wood, which he immediately causing to be surrounded, so ferreted them about, that 30 of them, together with <hi>Casheen</hi> their Ring-Leader or Captain, were killed. And 250 Foot, and 20 Horse commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Hodson,</hi> marching from <hi>Mountmelick,</hi> he posted them at <hi>Kilkapog</hi> by break of day, where the Foot entred the Woods and Bogs, and the Horse securing the skirts, they hunted out and killed about 18 of the Enemy that lay lurking there to surprize such as passed that way; and indeed these sort of Enemies were more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and cruel where they mastered, than the Regular Troops, but so cowardly withal, that they would not stand a Charge, if they perceived the Match was but any thing near equal; an Instance of which may be observed in this, <hi>viz.</hi>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:37916:68"/> very unfortunately, that a Serjeant and 4 Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of this Party lagged behind a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way; upon these the Rapparees seized, and though on their knees they begged for Quarter, yet they murthered them, and not satisfied with their Deaths, they bored out their Eyes, and mangled their dead Bodies; but the next day three of the Murtherers were taken and brought to <hi>Mullingar,</hi> where one of them accused the other two of the Fact; they were upon such Conviction immediately hanged up: and Captain <hi>Poyn</hi> soon after falling upon the whole Knot of them with a Party of 110 Men of the Garrison of <hi>Mullingar,</hi> put to the rout, and dispersed throughout the Country, killing between 40 and 50 of them. And now since we have had occasion to speak so much of these Rapparees in the Series of this History, some may be inquisitive to know what manner of People they are: To which I answer,</p>
            <p>They are a sort of Vagabonds and Thieves, not caring to Work, or take any Employment upon them; a mixture of <hi>Irish</hi> with other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who herding together, take all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, where they are strongest, to plunder, burn and murther, their hands being against all, and the hands of all against them, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy as Beasts of Prey. They rejoyce at Wars and Troubles, because then they have liberty they think to do what they please. Their Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings for the most part are Cabins, or moveable Houses, and their skulking places Bogs, Woods and Mountains. They are not held as Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor included in the Articles of War, but
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:37916:69"/> lie at the mercy of those that take them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their being obliged to give them any Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though they crave it. Their Apparel, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they rig themselves by Plunder, is so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, that they go in a manner naked.</p>
            <p>Yet these hopeful Sticks, the Commanders of the <hi>Irish</hi> Army encourage, and put Weapons into many of their hands, to harress and destroy the Countries under their Majesties Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Yet they have been so often met with upon their Incursions, that about 4000 of them have come short home since this War begun.</p>
            <p>And furthermore, to encourage the People to be vigilant, and to discourage such Rakeshames, the Lords Justices and Council of <hi>Ireland,</hi> put forth a Proclamation in these words, or to this effect:</p>
            <p>
               <q>THat to prevent the Robberies, wilful Burnings of Buildings, Corn and Hay, Murthers and Insurrection, with which the parts of the Kingdom under their Majesties Obedience was threatned by the Rebels and their Adherents, during the time their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Army should be upon their march to the Frontiers, or in the Quarters then pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed by the Rebels, they have thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and do thereby publish and declare, That the Popish <hi>Irish</hi> Inhabitants of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Baronies under their Majesties Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, where any Rebels commonly called
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:37916:69"/> Rapparees, shall commit any such Robberies Burnings or Murthers; or where any such Insurrection shall happen, if they do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately give Notice of such Rapparees and Insurrections respectively to the Justice of Peace, or chief Officer of the Militia next to their Habitations, and assist him in the taking and destroying them, and in the suppression of Insurrections; that then they, where such Fact shall be committed, neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Duties, shall be deemed Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates with the said Rebels, and Enemies of their Majesties Government: And by Order to be given by the Lords Justices, as occasion shall require, shall be proceeded against with the utmost severity of Military Execution. And they do further Order, That no protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Irish</hi> Papist shall be abroad out of his or their Dwelling-place of Abode, after the hours of Nine at Night, or before the hours of Four in the Morning, under the Pain and Penalty of being put out of their Majesties Protection. And if after the Thirtieth of <hi>May, 1691.</hi> any Arms or Ammunition shall be found upon the persons, or in the possession of any such <hi>Irish</hi> Papists, he or they shall be looked upon as Rebels, and punished accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: And as they intend severely to punish all such as shall offend in the particulars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned, so they do assure all those
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:37916:70"/>
                  <hi>Irish Papists</hi> who live under their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties protection, that they behaving themselves as becomes good Subjects, shall have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereof.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These Proceedings made many of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists stir to prevent the mischief, who before stood laughing in their sleeves at the Damages their Protestant Neighbours sustained, though to curry favour in a dissembling manner, they often shewed them a fair Countenance, and seemed to pity their Losses. And Major <hi>O Neal</hi> and some others, came over from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and took the advantage of their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Protection.</p>
            <p>But whilst these things were transacting, one <hi>Mark Baggot</hi> apparelling himself in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Clothes, made it his business to spy into our Quarters, and the manner of Affairs; but his too much inquisitiveness discovering him, he was seized, and being sentenced by a Court Marshal, he was executed at <hi>Dublin</hi> on the 20th of <hi>May.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Season thus far in a forwardness, gave a favourable Invitation to the Army, for their taking the field, when a Party of the <hi>Irish</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, consisting of 150 Men, thinking to be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at it, and do some notable Exploit to be talked on, came to <hi>Castle-Lions,</hi> and took thence a few of the poor peoples Cows; but Colonel <hi>Donep</hi> with about 20 <hi>Danes,</hi> and a like number of the Militia, Dragoons pursued, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking them at <hi>Ballyderdawn,</hi> where a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant with 8 <hi>Danes,</hi> and 6 <hi>Dragoons,</hi> beat off
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:37916:70"/> 60 of them who had lined the Hedges, in which Action the Lieutenant was killed; but the Colonel coming up with his Party, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reinforced with 50 fresh Men, he still pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued them, killing about 50 of them, of which 2 were Commission Officers, took 40 Horses, and his Men got indifferent store of Plunder.</p>
            <p>This was followed with other Successes of the like nature, nor could any great Actions be expected, by reason the Armies were not as yet in the field, our staying for the arrival of more Ships from <hi>England;</hi> and the <hi>Irish</hi> upon the like account from <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And about the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> 8 Ships with 500 Carriage-Horses, and other Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for the Army came to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General <hi>Scravenmore,</hi> Major-General <hi>Mackay,</hi> and Major-General <hi>Ruvigny</hi> came likewise on Shoar. And now the Train of Artillery consisted of 39 Pieces of Cannon, 12 Field-pieces, and 6 Mortars.</p>
            <p>And in the mean while the <hi>French</hi> General St. <hi>Ruth</hi> proceeded to model the <hi>Irish</hi> Army, and give Commissions in his Master's Name, ordering things with an Absolute Power, where their Troops drew together at <hi>Loghera</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the beginning of <hi>June</hi> all things on our part was in a manner in a readiness, the Soldiers by this time being well recruited of the hardships, found many of them in their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Quarters; and being often out in Parties.</p>
            <p>The Army indeed lay still longer than the <hi>Irish</hi> expected, which made them promise
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:37916:71"/> themselves more success than they were like to meet withal; for the General intending to make a vigorous War, and push on for speedy Victory, and the reducing all places that yet held out, and had refused to submit to their Majesties Obedience, took care so effectually to provide for all things necessary for enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing so great an Undertaking, that nothing might be wanting to retard in the least the progress of their Majesties Arms; and because the Stores laid up the Year before as to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and other things of that nature, whereby the Army might subsist in its March, it was prudently taken into Consideration, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture should have time to do her part, in furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Earth with such a sufficiency as might supply what was wanting, if any delays by cross Accidents should happen, that so every thing that could be expected might contribute to the sudden and effectual reducing the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and putting an end to so chargeable a War; whereby the Forces upon so happy a Conclusion, as must necessarily restore Peace in these parts, might be at leisure to oppose the grand Disturber of <hi>Europe</hi> in a more sensible manner; seeing it was concluded his main Policy in assisting the <hi>Irish,</hi> was only to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert those Troops he otherwise could not without reason expect, would make him an unwelcome Visit upon his own Frontiers, and joyntly labour to plant the Rightful Monarch in the Field of Golden Lilies.</p>
            <p>These Considerations, I say, being of weight, presaged the unparallel'd Success in a great
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:37916:71"/> measure, that attended and crowned them to our wishes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Irish,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> in Confederacy with them, held several strong Towns; such as were not thought easily to be reduced; as <hi>Ballymore,</hi> the two Towns of <hi>Athlone, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway</hi> and <hi>Lymerick,</hi> besides a numerous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that had already taken the field, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to themselves great matters from their Valour and Conduct, as now supposing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves better disciplined than the Year before; for they had amongst them a great many <hi>French</hi> Officers, who laboured to exercise and train them up in the Arts and Methods used in the <hi>French</hi> Army. And indeed, had they had to do with any other Nation but the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> they might have come off better than they did in the oppositions they made; but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>British</hi> Valour revived in so short a War, took again its insuperable vigour, resolving to overcome all Difficulties, and stick at no Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but furiously press on where the least glimmering of Victory presented, and so like a rapid Torrent forcing the opposing Dams, carrying all before it, and Crown their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs with sprouting Laurels and Triumphs.</p>
            <p>But not longer to detain the Reader from matter of Fact, which is mainly the intended Scope of this History: The Supplies expected from <hi>England</hi> being seasonably arrived, and every thing that was thought necessary in a readiness, there wanted but Orders to march; which were not delayed; for now, as is said, the Army being ready to take the field, our
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:37916:72"/> Forces were commanded to Decamp, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly Decamped from <hi>Mullingar;</hi> and the same day the Army was joyned by Lieutenant-General <hi>Douglas,</hi> with the Northern Troops, and on the Seventh of <hi>June</hi> came before <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymore,</hi> seizing upon all the Enemies Out-posts, which they quitted upon the approach of our Men; but being taken, the Serjeant was hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for firing after the Communication was then cut off between him and the Town.</p>
            <p>In the Afternoon a Battery of four Field-pieces was bent against the Fort, and five Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries were raised the Night following, from whence our Cannon rent the Walls and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; and the General sent to the Governour to let him know, <hi>That if he and the Garrison would Surrender within two hours, he would save their Lives, and make them Prisoners of War; if not, they must expect no Quarter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which the Governour made no direct Answer; but reply'd, <hi>He hoped to get better Terms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Cannon having made two great Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and sour Boats brought from <hi>Mullingar,</hi> put into the Water, the fear of a present Storm made the Besieged hang out a white Flag, and Colonel <hi>Bourk,</hi> with several Officers, came and submitted to the General at discretion: So that Colonel <hi>Earl</hi> with 400 Men marched in and took possession of the place; in which there was a Garrison of 780 Soldiers, besides 259 Rapparees well armed, and about 1000 Women and Children.</p>
            <p>In this Action we had 8 Men killed, and the Enemy above 150.</p>
            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:37916:72"/>
            <p>This important place thus reduced, and the Prince of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> having joyned the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with about 12000 Horse and Foot, the March was directed towards <hi>Athlone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the Nineteenth our Men came before the place, where they had put up the <hi>French</hi> Colours in four parts of the Town, to make us believe there were a great many <hi>French</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garrisoned in it: but this hindred not; for by Ten in the Morning a Battery of Ten eighteen Pounders was finished; and playing upon the Great Bastion, in a short time the Face-flank and Curtain were laid in Rubbish, and the General ordered the Assault to be made in this order.</p>
            <p>First there advanced 300 detach'd Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
            <p>Then 50 Pioneers with more Faggots.</p>
            <p>Then 200 Feusileers, supported by two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Foot.</p>
            <p>After them 200 Pioneers with more Faggots.</p>
            <p>Then 20 Men with Axes to cut the Barro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades, if any opposed.</p>
            <p>So that about Six in the Evening, on the Twentieth of <hi>June,</hi> the Signal was given to fall on, which was the Discharge of all the Cannon in Battery.</p>
            <p>At first the Enemy seemed resolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Breach; but upon the first flight of the <hi>English</hi> Granadoes, they scattered and fled in much confusion over the Bridge to the <hi>Irish</hi> Town on <hi>Connaught</hi> side, some leaping into the <hi>Shannon</hi> for haste, and there perished in the Waters.</p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:37916:73"/>
            <p>Our Men immediately entred the <hi>English</hi> Town; but lying somewhat open to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies shot on the other side the River, some few were killed, and others wounded; but the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineers soon raised Blinds to shelter them.</p>
            <p>On our part of note, Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Coar,</hi> and Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Villier</hi>'s Regiment were killed, one entring the Breach, and the other surveying the Town from a Hill.</p>
            <p>The Siege was carried on against the other Town with great Resolution; so that having battered it till the Walls and Castle were part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beat down, and perceiving it saultable, order was then given for the storming of the place.</p>
            <p>On the 28th of <hi>June,</hi> about Seven in the Morning, much in the same order as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Attack was made, yet the Detachments were greater, as being a stronger place: but before our Men could be in a readiness, a small part of the Enemy came and set fire to a close Gallery laid over the Arch of a Stone-bridge, they had broken down, but were many of them killed in the Attempt; yet it deferred the Attack till the Thirtieth.</p>
            <p>However the Cannon and Bombs ceased not to play, and do terrible Execution, setting the Houses on fire, and beating down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
            <p>About Six in the Afternoon the Signal was given to fall on by ringing the Church-Bell; whereupon they entred the Ford below the Bridge, and pressed with such vigour upon the Enemy, that they forced them to quit the Trenches, and within the space of half an
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:37916:73"/> hour made themselves Masters of all their Outworks, and the Ruins of the Castle where they had fortified themselves with Sconces; and Major-General <hi>Maxwell</hi> with 200 Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and divers Officers of note, were made Prisoners.</p>
            <p>Yet in the Soldiers over-running the Town in the first fury, a great many were killed; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, 2000 are computed to be slain from the beginning of the Siege, till the <hi>English</hi> were entire Masters of the Town.</p>
            <p>The place was taken in the sight of the <hi>Irish</hi> Army, who, when too late, were sending a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to their Relief. There were found only 6 Pieces of Brass Cannon, and 2 Mortars, but little store of Provision and Ammunition.</p>
            <p>The Principal Officers kill'd of the <hi>Irish</hi> were Brigadier <hi>Mackellicuddy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Colonels <hi>Mac Mahon, O Neal, O Gard,</hi> and <hi>Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lieutenant-Colonels, <hi>Mac Genis</hi> and <hi>Barnwell,</hi> also Major <hi>Murray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Enemy had all the advantage imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to Relieve this important Place, as lying with their whole Army on the other side, but a little distance from it, where we had no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; or if any, none capable of opposing them at that time; yet so infatuated they were, that relying on its strength, they still had a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that the Town beyond the River would baffle the <hi>English</hi> Courage, notwithstanding they saw the other Town was taken with a very little resistance.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>St. Ruth,</hi> and other of their chief
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:37916:74"/> Commanders, were reported to be often in it, viewing its Works and Fortifications, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured themselves it would at least be a great part of the Summers Work to reduce it, if they were not in the end obliged to draw off from before it; and the rather, because some part of our Army had been before it, and gone off without any considerable Success, or doing any great matters against the Place.</p>
            <p>But their Imaginations answered not, as it has appeared. Their Expectations, and those Supplies, as is said that they sent, came so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably late, that all the advantage they had, was to put a stop to our Mens pursuing too far such as got out of the Town, and fled for shelter towards their Army. This sensible Blow greatly damped the Courage and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Enemy, who before had promised to do great things, and made them bethink themselves of taking new measures; insomuch that some took the opportunity, as they found occasion, to desert.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> seemed discontented with the weak Resistance of the <hi>Irish;</hi> and every thing appeared more and more dreadful to this nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Army.</p>
            <p>When several Consultations were held what was best to be done, whether to remove or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the <hi>English</hi> in that Camp; for they could not propose any thing less to themselves, than that after this Success our Forces would give them a nearer Visit, and attempt the dislodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from a place so near a Town newly taken, and now very weak in it self by Battery.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:37916:74"/> And though they talked high, yet in all their Debates it did not, it seems, appear they had any great mind to come to a fight; but rather to delay our Army, till the Season should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to put a stop to any considerable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, or till they might find some great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to further their purpose.</p>
            <p>Whilst the Enemies Considerations run to this purpose, our Men were gathering the Plunder of the Place; which was not so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable as in so strong a Town might have been expected; for besides what had been burnt in the Fires that had happened by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of Bombs, and destroyed in the beating down of Houses, some of the chief Inhabitants early apprehending this Siege, had removed what was valuable, together with themselves, to distant places, where they thought them more secure; though by the way part fell into the hands of the Rapparees, who distinguished not between Friend or Foes, where they found opportunity to get Booty. But to come nearer.</p>
            <p>The Enemy, after several Debates, perceiving our Men were absolute Masters of the Place, which was in a manner laid in Rubbish by the throwing in 600 Bombs, and the force of 1200 great Shot, they came to a Result; and it was concluded immediately to raise their Camp, and march some Miles further; which they did: and to increase their number, drew the Garrisons of <hi>Sligo, James-Town,</hi> and <hi>Lanes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> quitting them to those that would come and take possession.</p>
            <p>As soon as the Walls of <hi>Athlone</hi> were a little
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:37916:75"/> repaired, the General left a Garrison there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of Colonel <hi>Lloyd,</hi> and drew out to observe the Enemies motion.</p>
            <p>The Enemy, to amuze us, gave out, they were resolved to come to a Battel; when for the supply of our Army, divers Vessels with Ammunition and other Stores, arrived from <hi>England,</hi> and bringing over likewise the Earl of <hi>Portland</hi>'s Regiment of Horse, who soon joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Army.</p>
            <p>It was now resolved to dislodge the Enemy, or oblige them to fight.</p>
            <p>Their Majesties Forces on the Tenth of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> passed the River, the Foot over a Bridge of Boats below the Town, and the Horse over a Stone-bridge that had been repaired for their more advantagious passage, and marched to <hi>Ballinsloe,</hi> a place on the River <hi>Sac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Enemy lying three Miles distant, very advantagiously encamped at a place called <hi>Aghrim,</hi> a small Town, stretching their Left towards <hi>Kilconnel</hi>-Abbey, and their Right up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Hills of <hi>Kilcomodon,</hi> having two very difficult Bogs before them, through which the Roads go to <hi>Galloway:</hi> And on the Left was the Ruines of an old Castle, where an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment was made and lined with Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers; and on the Right likewise were several Retrenchments for the Security of their Camp.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> Army passed the River <hi>Sac,</hi> the Foot and Artillery over a Stone-bridge, and the Horse by two Fords, forcing the Out-Guards to retreat, whilst our Left Wing of Horse advanced beyond the Bog that covered
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:37916:75"/> the Enemies Right, and made way for the Foot to come in, between them and that.</p>
            <p>Our Cannon fired upon the Enemies Guards at the end of the Defile or dirty Lane that leads to <hi>Aghrim,</hi> dislodged them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended it, whilst our Horse and Foot took their Posts, pouring in their Shot.</p>
            <p>The Enemy drew down a great Body of Horse towards our Left, and were so strongly possessed behind the high Banks of the Ditches, that they held our Foot in dispute for 2 hours, before they could gain any thing considerable upon them; but at last we prevailed, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to give way, notwithstanding fresh Recruits of Horse and Foot were sent to sustain them, as they were pushed back; and although three Battalions of Foot advanced on the Right, over the Skirts of the Bog, and a small Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let that discharged it self into the <hi>Sac,</hi> where in a Corn field others of the Enemies Battalions and Squadrons stood firm to the Charge; yet they notwithstanding maintained their ground, till more of our Regiments and Squadrons ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to support them; and then Charging up the Hills where the Enemies Squadrons were posted, gave them a warm Entertainment.</p>
            <p>In the mean time our Left had opportunity to beat the <hi>Irish</hi> from their Ground; and at the same time the Right pressing upon them, disordered them to that degree, that a general Rout of their Horse ensued; and their Foot thereupon being hotly charged, fell into disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and though they had made a resolute Resistance, they were obliged to quit the field,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:37916:76"/> and were pursued by our Army four Miles; but then Night coming on, and the difficulty of the ways hindred the further pursuit, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 6 in the Evening when the Armies enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and near 9 before they broke and fled.</p>
            <p>The Enemies Army was superiour to ours, consisting of 20000 Foot, and 8000 Horse, and had by their Encampment all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; yet our Men gained an entire Victory, 7000 of the Enemy being killed upon the place.</p>
            <p>Among the slain of note were the Lord <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway,</hi> Colonel <hi>Moor,</hi> Colonel <hi>Baker,</hi> Colonel <hi>Gourdon,</hi> a great many Captains, Lieutenants, Ensigns, Cornets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and more particularly Monsieur <hi>St. Ruth,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> General, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived here his Reward for the many Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he used towards the Protestants in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many of note were wounded, of which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mortally, and soon after died of their Wounds.</p>
            <p>About 100 Officers and 500 Soldiers were made Prisoners; and all the Enemies Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Tents, Baggage and Cannon fell into the hand of our Men, with a great many Colours and Standards, and most of the Arms of the Foot, which to help their speed in flight, they threw away.</p>
            <p>This great and entire Victory was obtained with the loss of 600 Men on our side; and of note Major-General <hi>Holstable,</hi> Colonel <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats,</hi> Colonel <hi>Charles Herbert,</hi> Major-General <hi>Petit,</hi> Major <hi>Davenish,</hi> Major <hi>Colt,</hi> Major <hi>Cornwal,</hi> Major <hi>Fox,</hi> with divers Subalternate Officers.</p>
            <pb n="141" facs="tcp:37916:76"/>
            <p>The wounded of note were the Prince of <hi>Hesse Darmstadt,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> the Lord <hi>George Hamilton,</hi> Colonel <hi>Earl,</hi> Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Burdwell,</hi> with several Subalternates.</p>
            <p>The Enemy in this flight and total rout scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their Arms and Baggage all the way they fled, thinking as it may be by that means to stay the pursuit: but it availed them little; for such Trifles were not regarded, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of the Great Work that was in hand, to subdue and bring the Kingdom under their Majesties Obedience by an entire Conquest; insomuch, that urged by the Sword behind, and not finding way to escape through the press and throng that was before them, a great many cast themselves into the Bogs and Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plashes, and of these not very many escaped.</p>
            <p>Others that were more nimble of Foot, and had got the start of the press, scampered by known ways, and never left running when the pursuit was given over, till they got to the Woods or Mountains, or into such Bogs where they thought it was impossible to follow them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French,</hi> who were not so nimble as the <hi>Irish,</hi> or if they had, yet but very little acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Country, came mostly by the worst on it, where they were broken and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, throwing away their Arms, and crying for Quarter, which in the heat of the Soldiers fury could not be always obtained.</p>
            <p>Some of the Enemies Horse indeed retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pretty indifferently, keeping together as well as the Confusion would permit; but thought it not safe to stay in the Countries
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:37916:77"/> thereabout, for fear of being attacked by some of our Detachments the next day; but being got at a great distance, and those that were scattered coming to their Rendezvous, they made a small Body under the Command of Colonel <hi>Sheldon,</hi> and some other Officers; but the Foot was so entirely dispersed, that we heard little of them afterward, unless such as got into the Places that yet held out, and even there many of the Fugitives were refused, the Garrisons being already filled up and straitned for Provision, so that for a time lying under the Walls, and hankering about without any thing wherewith materially to subsist, many disbanded of themselves, and others by the leave of their Officers, as finding this great Blow had broken their Hopes and Interests in the Kingdom so far, that they even despaired of piecing it together again by force; and withal knowing no doubt, that this would be such unwelcome News to <hi>France,</hi> that although the late King resided in that Court to solicite on their behalfs, they could expect but little Succours, seeing all that had been already sent had turned to so little account; and that the <hi>English</hi> heightned by this Success, knew well enough how to take the advantage, and push on to the Walls of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> wherein, as their last Refuge, they had placed some hopes.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were employing the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies serious Consideration, care was taken of our wounded Men; and such Prisoners as had been secured, who received very good Usage, and what else was requisite, till they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:37916:77"/> should be disposed of as Prisoners of War.</p>
            <p>The Victory thus entirely gained, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my encamped beyond the place of Battel, and Brigadier <hi>Eppinger</hi> goin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> out with a strong Party, possessed himself of <hi>Portumney,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Fort and Castle of <hi>Bavaher</hi> surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and many of the scattered Forces fled to <hi>Galloway</hi> and <hi>Lymerick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the greatest part of the Standards and Colours taken in this Battel, they were sent to <hi>England,</hi> and there exposed to the publick view of the People, as eminent Trophies of so sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal a Victory.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> Army upon the former Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, resolute to push on for the entire reducing the Kingdom to their Majesties Obedience, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some refreshment, marched towards <hi>Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being before the place, the General sent a Trumpet to the Lord <hi>Dillon,</hi> Governour of the Town, to offer him advantagious Terms in case he Surrendred before the Cannon were planted against the Walls.</p>
            <p>But he returned for answer, <hi>That Monsieur</hi> Ussone <hi>the</hi> French <hi>Lieutenant-General, who commanded, was of the same Opinion with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and the rest of the Officers; and that they were resolved to defend the place to the last.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which the Approaches were made, and on the 20th of <hi>July</hi> by break of day, a Fort or Ravelin on the Hill was attacked, and our Granadiers that were ordered for that purpose, marched with great silence; insomuch that they were not discovered till they were at the Foot
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:37916:78"/> of the Glacis, where they delivered their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado's, and went on to the Pallisado's, entring the Fort.</p>
            <p>The Enemy perceiving all was lost, cried for Quarter, leaving our Men Masters of it; so that they strongly retrenched themselves: but hearing that <hi>Baldorick O Donnel</hi> was on his March to throw himself into <hi>Galloway,</hi> the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was bridged over with the Tin Boats, over which passed 6 Regiments of our Foot, and 4 Squadrons of Horse to oppose his Attempt: so that finding he could not effect his Design, he retreated into the County of <hi>Mayo,</hi> burning and plundering in his way.</p>
            <p>The taking this Fort so Alarm'd the Town, that the Governour desired a Parley, and leave to send some Persons to the General to treat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Articles of Surrender; so that three of their Lieutenant-Colonels came out, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ours entred the Town, by way of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stage; and after some debate it was agreed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Town should be delivered to such Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers as the General should appoint; and in the mean time five Hostages should be sent for the due performance of the Agreement on the Articles; and all the Outworks of the Town put into the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals hands, the Enemy forbearing to fortifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in the mean time; and to withdraw all their Cannon from the Walls; but that our Men might be permitted to work and post themselves us they saw convenient, provided they came not within three yards of the Wall, or placed any Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non on the Batteries that should be made: And that the Garrison and Townsmen should have the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:37916:78"/> benefit of the Lords Justices Proclamation of Indempnity, which gives them their Estates and Liberties. And further, that those who were desirous to depart, might be conducted to</hi> Lyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, <hi>with their Arms, Drums beating,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and six pieces of Cannon; and have liberty to send to</hi> Tyrconnel, <hi>and acquaint him with what they had done, and invite him to do the same at</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick.</p>
            <p>That pursuant thereto they sent the Lord <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> with four Officers of note as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages, and allowed two Persons sent from the General to enter the Town, and take an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Stores, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Treaty upon these Considerations co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to a final Conclusion, the Garrison march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out on the 26th of <hi>July, D'Ʋssone</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Lieutenant-General having leave to be on his way to <hi>Lymerick,</hi> three hours before the rest marched out.</p>
            <p>On the 28th of <hi>July</hi> Matters being settled, and the Place garrisoned, the Army marched away towards <hi>Lymerick,</hi> the only strong Place the <hi>Irish</hi> held in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things passed, Sir <hi>Teague O Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> delivered up <hi>Slego</hi> to Colonel <hi>Mickleburn,</hi> and divers other Places of no considerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence were Surrendred by others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baldarick O Donnel,</hi> whose Success an old Prophecy had foretold, fearing by the ill luck he all along had had, it was but a Fable, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to submit with the Men under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, sent to desire a Cessation on this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:37916:79"/> and that some place might be assigned him and his followers, till his Majesty was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his Proposals for coming over; which was in part allowed him, and he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was received into their Majesties Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
            <p>Now our Parties being abroad, entred those Counties that held out, and brought away great Booties of Cattel, defeating divers of the Enemies Detachments that were abroad, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Country.</p>
            <p>Upon the approach of the <hi>English</hi> Army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Lymerick,</hi> the Enemy, who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped near it, no sooner perceived the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced Parties, but their Foot entred the Town, and their Horse drew off further into the Country.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> finding the Thread he had spun grew too fine, and ready to break in sunder, vexing at the crosness of Affairs, fell sick and died, as 'tis reported, of Grief, being buried in <hi>Lymerick,</hi> the place where he died.</p>
            <p>On the 11th of <hi>August</hi> our Army marched from <hi>Nenagh</hi> to <hi>Shalley,</hi> about two Miles from the Silver Mines.</p>
            <p>The next day to <hi>Tusla,</hi> where to refresh them they remained one day.</p>
            <p>But the next day the General being resolved to push on and prosecute the Success, they had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to march to <hi>Larrick-en-Lysh,</hi> about 4 miles from <hi>Lymerick,</hi> the only place wherein the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy reposed their last hopes, as having yet some small glimmering of hope, which they reposed in a Continual expectation of some fresh Succours from <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="147" facs="tcp:37916:79"/>
            <p>From <hi>Carrick</hi> the next day the General went with 1500 Horse and Dragoons within sight of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> beating in their Out-guards, and taking a view of their Out-works from a Hill that over-look'd the City where our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery encamped the last Year; and upon his being there, several Deserters came over, and confirmed an Account before received, that the Horse were retired to the other side of the <hi>Shannon,</hi> and their Foot drawn within the Retrenchments.</p>
            <p>Further informing, That upon <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Death, a Commission was produced under the late King's hand, which Mr. <hi>Plowden</hi> (former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of the Commissioners of the Revenue) had brought lately from <hi>France,</hi> impowering Sir <hi>Alexander Fitton,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Neagle,</hi> and the said <hi>Plowden,</hi> Justices of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And a further Account was given, That di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Persons were seized and made Prisoners in <hi>Lymerick,</hi> by the order of the <hi>French</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Ʋssone,</hi> for having made some Proposals in order to a timely Surrender. Upon which the General sent them word by a Trumpet, <hi>That if they put any Man to death for having a mind to come over to him, he would retaliate it on the</hi> Irish <hi>Prisoners that had been lately taken, and were now in his power.</hi> Of which indeed there were a great many, and some of no mean qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Titles, besides Officers of considerable note, upon the account of their late Commands in the <hi>Irish</hi> Garrisons or Army.</p>
            <p>On the 16th Sir <hi>John Hanmore</hi> joyned the General with five Regiments of Foot from
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:37916:80"/>
               <hi>Cork,</hi> and the Neighbouring Garrisons; as also some other Re-inforcements from divers adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent places, as well Horse as Foot.</p>
            <p>The same day Major-General <hi>La-Forest</hi> was sent out with a strong Detachment to meet the Cannon, but with some impatience had been expected from <hi>Athlone,</hi> under the Convoy of Colonel <hi>Loyd</hi>'s Regiment; and though in the mean time a great deal of Rain fell, yet it nothing abated the Courage of the Officers and Soldiers, to go on in prosecuting the intended Siege of <hi>Lymerick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To further whose purpose, a Squadron of <hi>English</hi> Ships were in the <hi>Shannon,</hi> who made themselves Masters of a <hi>French</hi> Ship of consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Burthen, which had taken in <hi>St. Ruth</hi>'s Horse and Equipage, in order to carry it for <hi>France;</hi> after which they braved the City of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> by coming almost within Cannon shot of it.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were doing, and the Lord Justice <hi>Coningsby,</hi> who had been to concert Matters in the Army, was returning from <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Militia were in a readiness to keep those Parts in quiet, consisting of 1000 Foot, and 500 Horse and Dragoons, having with them 3 Field-pieces; whilst others of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of the neighbouring Counties were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to augment their Number, and make them up 3000 effectual Men, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Earl of <hi>Granard,</hi> their business be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewise to secure such Places as might fall into their hands by force, or being aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the Enemy.</p>
            <pb n="149" facs="tcp:37916:80"/>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> Army having been some time retarded at <hi>Carrick-en-Lesh,</hi> in expectation of the heavy Cannon, upon its arrival in the Camp, marched on the 25th of <hi>August</hi> nearer to <hi>Lymerick,</hi> and took in divers places by the way, and especially those near <hi>Lymerick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In one Fort new built, and Garrison'd with 600 Men, made great shew of Resistance, yet upon an Attack made by 8 of our Granadiers, after they had fired upon them, killing one of our Men, they made a running Retreat, and by a Covert-way got within their Flank-lines drawn about the Town.</p>
            <p>Whilst the Army was preparing for a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Siege, a considerable Detachment of Foot and Horse, with some Cannon, was sent under the Command of the Prince <hi>Hesse Darmstadt,</hi> to take in <hi>Castle Conel,</hi> where the Enemy had a Garrison.</p>
            <p>Another Party was sent to take in three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Castles which the Enemy had garrison'd on the River below the Town, and enterprized them with good Success; yet at the first co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on of our Army before <hi>Lymerick,</hi> several Field-pieces and Cannon were planted so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to the Enemy, that playing upon a Regiment of Dragoons, and another of Horse, they obliged them to draw off to a further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; yet our Men advanced to <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Fort, which was quitted, as also was the Line of Communication they had made to the Church, retiring within the Retrenchments that were better secured by the Cannon of the Town. However, to come into Action, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:37916:81"/> of 80 Granadiers were commanded to attack one of their Out-works, which was a new Fort guarded by 600 Men, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing upon the approach of our Granadiers, having discharged their Pieces, they fled by a Covered-way into the Town, and left us Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Fort; yet our Men pushing on, pursued the Fliers, killing some, and taking about 20 Prisoners, losing but one Man in the Action; and the same Night Colonel <hi>Donep,</hi> a Commander of the <hi>Danish</hi> Horse, was killed by a random shot.</p>
            <p>On the 26th of <hi>August</hi> the heavy Cannon and Mortars came up, and our Men began to work on the Lines of Communication, and the next day the Batteries were raised against <hi>Thomond</hi>-Bridge, whilst the Prince <hi>Hesse Darm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stadt</hi> march'd with a Detachment of Horse, Foot and Drrgoons, and 3 Pieces of Cannon to attack <hi>Castle Connel;</hi> and Lieutenant-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Scravenmore,</hi> with another detach'd Party, marched to <hi>Carrick Gunnel,</hi> which Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred upon the first Summons, the Garrison consisting of 250 Men, being made Prisoners of War. And our light Frigats with Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and Provision came to an Anchor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in sight of <hi>Lymerick;</hi> which the Besieged ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for Succours from <hi>France,</hi> were mainly heightned with Joy; but upon being undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, were as much dejected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Castle Connel,</hi> a very strong Fortress, was surrendred to the Prince, and several other small Castles at divers times, in all which were taken about 900 Prisoners.</p>
            <pb n="151" facs="tcp:37916:81"/>
            <p>The Siege began by this time very much to streighten <hi>Lymerick,</hi> insomuch that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged could not without great difficulty have any considerable Communication with their Parties abroad; for their Horse had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by our shot from their Camp that was under the Cannon of the Town, and obliged to march a great way further; yet they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very vigilent in guarding the Passes of the <hi>Shannon,</hi> posting their Troops upon many of the Fords, and frequently sent their Scouts along the further Bank, to observe the motion of our Men, and to give notice to their Main-Guards, if they perceived them about to make an Attempt for passing it. However, that little availed, as will by and by appear.</p>
            <p>The reducing of <hi>Lymerick</hi> being firmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, our Men went on vigorously with the Works, making a Line of Contravallation with 4 Forts, for the better defending it from any Attack the Enemy might make upon it in their Sallies, and raised new Batteries on the Right, almost in the same place where the Attack was made upon the place the last year, the largest of them being within Carbine-shot of the Wall, in a place where it was held not to be extraordinary strong; and indeed the Cannon being mounted, and playing furious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against it, made the Stones shiver, and with a few Balls rent it in several places, that the Breaches began to appear at a great distance, whilst the Bombs thrown into the Town made great havock, so that the Flames of the fired Houses frequently ascending very dreadful, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:37916:82"/> when it happened in the Night time, so that it might be discerned for many Miles round the Country, and divers were killed by the breaking of the Shell, blowing up and beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of Houses, and amongst those that had their lot to fall this way, was the Lady <hi>Dillon,</hi> and a great many were wounded and disabled from the Service; so that according to the report of some Deserters, they began greatly to murmur, especially the Militia, who had been forced thither after the Battel of <hi>Aghrim,</hi> complaining that their Wives and Children in their absence, were many of them in very great distress; and unless they might have liberty speedily to go and take care of them, they must perish for want: some of them urged the danger the place was in, and not likely to make a long Resistance against so powerful an Army, that had all manner of Recruits and Supplies at hand, as occasion should require it; when on the contrary, they were shut up within S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>However, to di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sipate these Discontents, it was caused to be rumored abroad amongst the Citizens and Soldiers, that the <hi>French</hi> were speedily expected with large Succours; but when it appeared very difficult to gain Credit, that they could be that way effectually reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by reason we had several Frigats carrying a considerable strength of Guns, and Men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the River to hinder their coming up that way; likewise a prevailing and victorious Army in the Field, to obstruct their putting
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:37916:82"/> in Succours by Land; it was then to quiet the Clamour, promised by Monsieu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <hi>D'Ʋsson,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Governour, That the Militia should be dismissed if Succours did not come from <hi>France</hi> within 12 days.</p>
            <p>But he failed them: or had he intended to have sent them home, the difficulty of getting away would have been very great, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, had they not first had leave from the General; for it was apprehended they would have thrust out a great many useless People to save their Provision, which occasioned a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eye upon the Passes, that few could get away without permission; yet some they thrust into an Island in the River, being mostly Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, where they must have starved, had not our Men in compassion fetched them off.</p>
            <p>During this care, and the vigorous carrying on of the Siege, further care was likewise ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the suppressing the Parties abroad; whereupon 300 Horse and Dragoons were sent to re-inforce those that were abroad, and bring into subjection the small Garrisons the Enemy yet held out against their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties in <hi>Kerry,</hi> and the neighbouring parts; and six Pieces of Cannon were likewise order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that Service; so that upon the approach of our Forces, most of them Surrendred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out opposition, and all the Country round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout became free and open, so that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:37916:83"/> appeared every where to be highly pleased, as now being under a better assurance of safety from Plunder, and the future Inconveniencies of a War, that had wasted almost all they had; so that contrary to the usual manner in this case frequently used, they were so far from flying, for the most part, with the little substance they had left, that the Villagers, and others that had taken Refuge there, met their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours with Tears of Joy, and welcomed them as their Deliverers; Peace and Rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever most sweet and pleasant to those, who precipitating themselves unadvisedly into Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, have had leisure to consider their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; and by the sharp convincing Arguments of Suffering, have known what it is to be rash, in undertaking what they could not reasonably expect to go through with against the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arms of a powerful Nation, contending with which <hi>Ireland</hi> has always been succesless.</p>
            <p>Things being thus ordered, the Out-Parties, unless so many as could keep the places taken in Obedience, returned to the Camp carrying thither some Prisoners of note; and amongst others, the Lord <hi>Castle Connel</hi> was brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; where, notwithstanding the advancing of the Season, the Soldiers shewed much reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and cheerfulness in their Undertaking to carry on their Works, and manage all other Matters for the Accomplishment of the main End of so brave an Undertaking; and though the Enemies great Guns from the Walls, Castles and Towers of the Town, kept a continual thundering; yet the great shot did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:37916:83"/> the progress they made in their advances.</p>
            <p>On the 30th of <hi>August</hi> 9 Mortars played a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Lymerick,</hi> whose Bombs set fire to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Houses; but the flame was soon extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.</p>
            <p>The next day 9 Pieces of Cannon were bent upon the Bridge to ruin it, and hinder thereby the Enemies Communication with their Camp: And that Night 2 Mortars more of 18 Inches Diameter, were placed in Battery; and two Batteries, one of fourteen, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ten Pieces, all Twenty four Pounders, were finished, and some Deserters came over, who gave but a melancholly Account of the posture of Affairs in the Town, as to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing badly armed, and worse provisioned.</p>
            <p>Now whilst the Siege went successfully on, upon Advice that a great Party of Rapparees were drawn together in the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> mixed with some of the Enemies Horse, the General ordered Brigadier <hi>Levison,</hi> with 1500 Horse and Dragoons to march against them, of which they had no sooner notice, but they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two Parties for their better Retreat; and the Brigadier did the like, and with part of his Detachment pursued one of the Parties, whilst Colonel <hi>Ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>enhuys</hi> did the like by the other; the Brigadier soon overtook his Party, which consisted of two Regiments of Horse, and a great number of Rapparees, which our Men charged so desperately, they making no considerable resistance, that they were soon broken and in rout, most of them being killed or taken Prisoners, and a great Booty recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:37916:84"/> which they had got in ravaging the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The Colonel did the like by the Party he pursued; which gave the Villages rest from their fears of burning and plundering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Cannon and Bombs continuing to play against <hi>Lymerick,</hi> the former beat down thirty Yards of the Wall of the <hi>English</hi> Town on the <hi>North-east</hi> side, dismounting the Enemies Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and laying them in Rubbish, whilst the latter set fire to three of their Magazines, one of Brandy, and two of Biskets; the Fire last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till Morning, and doing great damage, so that to save their other Provisions, they hastily removed them to more distant places; and their Horse that Encamped along the River, being removed by the Guns of our Frigats, encamped between the Town and <hi>Killaloo,</hi> that they might be at hand to defend the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of the <hi>Shannon.</hi> And now the General resolving the Army should pass the <hi>Shannon,</hi> in order to attack the <hi>Irish</hi> Horse in the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> and to streighten the Town on that side, the better to conceal the Design, a shew was made, as if he intended to ship away the heavy Cannon, and quit the small Castles and outward Fortifications; which the Enemy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for his being about to raise the Siege gave a great shout for Joy. But that Night our Men laid the Pontons over the River, about a Mile above the Town, and early the next Morning the Royal Regiment of Dragoons, with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of Horse and Foot, had passed over undiscovered by the Enemy; but as soon as Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadier <hi>Clifford,</hi> who lay with 4 Regiments of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:37916:84"/> Dragoons to guard the Passage, perceived our Troops had gained the Banks, he brought down his Men on Foot, their Horses being at Grass; but at the first Charge they fell into disorder, and from that to open flight.</p>
            <p>Being pursued by our Men, a great many of them were killed, some taken Prisoners in the flight, most of them flung away their Arms, and lest their Tents, Baggage, Saddles, Bridles, and other Accoutrements to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amongst our Men, with 2 Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and the Standard of <hi>Maxwel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Enemies Horse that encamped higher near <hi>Killaloo</hi> taking the Alarm, drew out; but it was only to get time to take down their Tents, and cover their Baggage; for as soon as our Troops advanced towards them, and had passed the first Defile, they hastily marched away in some disorder towards the Mountains.</p>
            <p>On the 15th of <hi>September</hi> the Lord <hi>Lisburn,</hi> as he was quitting the Trenches, was killed with a Cannon Bullet; and the next day Capt. <hi>Taaf</hi> came over from the Enemy, giving an Account, That the Town was almost ruined with our Bombs and great Guns; and that they had not above ten days Bread for Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the Garrison not consisting of above 600 able Men.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were doing, Col. <hi>Michel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi> marched with a Detachment of his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 500 of the Militia, 2 Troops of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, and 6 Field-pieces, encamping at <hi>Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefle,</hi> and then advancing towards <hi>Slego,</hi> which again was in the Enemies hands, beat
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:37916:85"/> in their Out-guards, and being joyned by the Lord <hi>Granard,</hi> who a little before had redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Castle of <hi>Balymont,</hi> that Garrisom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive of the danger they were in, capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated almost upon the same Articles that were allowed to <hi>Galloway,</hi> including in the Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation the Castles of <hi>Bellaby, New-Town,</hi> and <hi>Castle-Bourk,</hi> which were to be taken care of, provided they Surrendred within 4 hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Summons. And hereupon the Fort on the 15th of <hi>September</hi> was delivered up, and 600 Men marched out under the Command of Sir <hi>Teague O Regan,</hi> and left in the place 16 pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Cannon, and Col. <hi>Michelburn</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Governour: And now to return again to <hi>Lymerick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst the Siege was yet carried vigorously on, the General, with Lieutenant-General <hi>Scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venmore,</hi> being an the other side of the <hi>Shannon</hi> with 5000 Horse and Dragoons, and a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Detachment of Foot marched into the County of <hi>Clare</hi> with 12 Field-pieces, and 7 or 8 days Provision, to oblige the Enemies Horse to fight, or drive them further from <hi>Lymerick;</hi> whereupon they not only avoided coming to Action, but many of them dispersed and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded, so that their number daily lessened.</p>
            <p>Brigadier <hi>Levison</hi> with 250 Horse and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons had fallen upon the Enemy in <hi>Kerry,</hi> where they were about 3000 strong, and rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, killing a great many, and taking di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Officers Prisoners; by which means their Majesties Forces were entire Masters of the County: So that the General being now on
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:37916:85"/>
               <hi>Clare</hi> side of <hi>Lymerick</hi> with a strong Body of Horse, 10 Regiments of Foot, and 14 Pieces of Cannon; the rest of the Army remaining under the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> for the Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Works on the other side, on the 22d of <hi>September</hi> about Noon, our Troops drew up before the <hi>English</hi> Town, though the Enemies Cannon played upon them all the while from the Castle and several Towers, as also the small shot from the Flankers and Outworks.</p>
            <p>About four in the Afternoon the General or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Detachment to attack the Fort near <hi>Thomond</hi> Bridge. Whereupon the Enemy sent two great Detachments out of the Town, to support and defend those that were in the Fort: but our Men marched on with such Courage and Bravery, that notwithstanding this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement, they bore down all before them, pursuing with hot Execution the flying Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my over the Bridge, and brought such a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour upon the City, that Monsieur <hi>D'Ʋsson,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Governour of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> durst not lower the Draw-Bridge to let in his own Men, dreading least ours should enter with them; so that crouding on the Bridge in great numbers, our Men by perpetually pouring their Vollies of shot amongst them, made a miserable slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; insomuch, that from the foot of the Bridge to the Draw-bridge, nothing was to be seen but heaps of dead Bodies discolouring the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with Blood, and 600<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> were computed to be killed in this Action, and about 130 taken Prisoners; amongst whom was Col. <hi>Skelton,</hi> who being very much hurt, died soon after of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:37916:86"/> of his wounds; and our Men during this hot dispute, being very much exposed to the fire of the Town, were about 300 of them killed and wounded, but none of note.</p>
            <p>This resolute Enterprise of our Men brought such a Terrour upon the Garrison, that in the Afternoon a Parley was beaten round the Town, and notice was given, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were very much enraged against the <hi>French</hi> Governour for suffering so many Men to be cut off, by keeping them out of the City, that they had insulted, and could hardly be kept from using violence.</p>
            <p>The beating this Parley was to desire a Cessation of Firing and casting in Bombs; which was allowed till 9 the next Morning, when the Colonels <hi>Sarsfield</hi> and <hi>Wahop</hi> came out, and desired the Truce might continue a day longer, and that they might send to the 1500 Horse commanded by <hi>Sheldon</hi> in the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> to know whether they would be included in the Capitulation; which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: And on <hi>Septemb.</hi> 25. Col. <hi>Sheldon,</hi> and some of his Officers came to our Camp, and had leave given him to go into <hi>Lymerick,</hi> and consult with the Officers in Garrison; and the next day <hi>Sarsfield</hi> and <hi>Wahop</hi> came out again, and dined with the General, and Hostages were proposed to be exchanged, which being conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on, the L. <hi>Cutts</hi> Sir <hi>David Collier,</hi> Col. <hi>Piper,</hi> and Col. <hi>Tiffany</hi> were sent by the General; and the Town sent out the Lords <hi>Westmeath, Trimelstown, Lowth,</hi> and <hi>Evagh;</hi> so that the Cessation was continued, and the Garrison
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:37916:86"/> sent out their Proposals; but they were such as the General could not approve of; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore instead of answering them, he sent in twelve Articles which he would allow; and not to be unready to speak his mind in another Language, in case the Truce should be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by their refusal, he ordered the Cannon and Mortars to remain charged on their Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, ready to fire upon the first Command; which made the Besieged more reasonable in their Demands: so that the Commissioners for the Treaty coming forth again the same day, had a long Conference with those ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to treat with them by the General, and became more moderate.</p>
            <p>A very good prospect of Accommodation presented at this time; for we had of their Prisoners taken in the last Action, 2 Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Colonels, 2 Majors, 9 Captains, 7 Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, and 6 Ensigns. And this being likely to be a general Treaty for the Settlement of the Kingdom, the Lords Justices set forward from <hi>Dublin</hi> to be assisting at it, and arrived in the Camp the first of <hi>October,</hi> and after some Conferences with the Commissioners on the part of the Garrison, and their Troops in the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> the Articles of Surrender of the City of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> and the Castles of <hi>Clare</hi> and <hi>Ross,</hi> with all other Places and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles that were at that time in the hands of the <hi>Irish,</hi> were on the Third of <hi>October</hi> concluded and agreed on, and signed by the General and Lords Justices on the one side, and by the <hi>French</hi> Governour, and the Persons deputed by
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:37916:87"/> the Garrison on the other; and thereupon a Stone-Fort, and one of the Gates way put into the General's hands the same Evening; and the next day five of our Regiments marched into the <hi>Irish</hi> Town, it being among other things agreed, That the <hi>French,</hi> and such as are willing to go beyond the Seas, may continue in the <hi>English</hi> Town and the Island, till they can be Transported, and Shipping are to be got ready for that purpose.</p>
            <p>And seeing upon the Articles of this Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, the quiet and settlement of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try consisted, and upon signing which, it entirely returned to its Obedience, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite the Reader should not be ignorant at least of the Substance or Chief Matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them: They consisting in two Parts, Civil and Military.</p>
            <p>As for the Civil Part, it gave the Roman Catholicks the Exercise of their Religion, as far as was consistent with the Laws of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and as they enjoyed it in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in general that had been in Arms, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise under King <hi>James,</hi> except forfeiting Persons out of the Kingdom, should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed of what they could justly Claim, or were lawfully Entituled to in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and at any time since, by any Law or Laws that were in force in his Reign. And those of Trades or Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to return to them, and Exercise them as in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Second, on
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:37916:87"/> condition they took the Oath of Allegiance made by the <hi>English</hi> Parliament the First Year of their Majesties Reign.</p>
            <p>Merchants, and reputed Merchants, that were beyond the Seas, and had not born Arms since their Majesties Declaration of <hi>February</hi> 1689. were included, and to have the same benefit if they returned within the space of Eight Months after the Date of the Articles. As also were several Officers, <hi>viz.</hi> Colonel <hi>Simon Lutterel,</hi> Captain <hi>Rowland White, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice Eustace,</hi> and others who were gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, upon the account of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments remaining in <hi>Ireland,</hi> upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning in the space of Eighth Months, and taking the Oath above-mentioned; and those comprised and so submitting to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to have General Pardons of all At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainders, Treasons, and other Crimes and Offences against the Government, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted since the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Second. And that all things that have happened since the War, whereby Troubles, Suits, or Vexations may arise, should be passed over and indempnified to those comprised in the Articles to the Date thereof, to be mutual and reciprocal on both sides.</p>
            <p>Every Nobleman and Gentleman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised is allowed to ride with a Sword and Case of Pistols, and to have a Gun for the Defence of his House, or for Recreation; and that inhabited the City of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> or other Garrisons, might depart with their Goods,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:37916:88"/> Chattels and Provisions out of it, without being searched, or paying any Duties; and moreover, not to be compelled to leave their Lodgings in six Weeks ensuing the Date of the Articles. The Roman Catholicks that submit, to take the Oath of Allegiance, and no other. And if any Person or Persons, at any time break any of these Premisses, he shall shall not cause any other, not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in such Breach, to forfeit the benefit of them; and that such Persons as are included, shall have the favour of the Lords Justices and General, to use their Endeavours to have them protected from Arrests, Execution, Debts and Damages for the space of Eight Months. That Provision be made to enable Colonel <hi>John Brown,</hi> by restoring so much of his Estate and Effects as were taken away, to pay his Debts: The Matter to be stated, and agreed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus things proceeded of this kind advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous for the quieting of the Minds of the People, and settling in Peace and Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>As for the Military Articles, the Substance of them were:</p>
            <p>That any Persons willing to leave the Kingdom, might pass with their Goods and Families, except into <hi>England, Scotland;</hi> and for the Officers and Soldiers, and those called Rapparees, that are minded to go, Ships should be prepared to transport them, and days and places appointed for those that were
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:37916:88"/> willing to go to declare their Minds to that purpose, and be reduced under their Officers that are to conduct them: And the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Officers that serve in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be included in the Capitulation, for the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Estates and Effects in the Three Kingdoms, if they are content to remain here, or for passing freely into <hi>France,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Country to serve, and Land-carriage and Shipping to be furnished for those of all Conditions that are not Prisoners of War, that have a mind to be Transported, and they to be protected from all Wrongs and Injuries: And the Ships that are to Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, to be furnished with Necessaries for Horse and Men, to be paid for by those Transported upon their safe arrival in <hi>France,</hi> and Hostages were to be left for the safe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Ships, the danger of the Sea ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; and till their Embarkation Quarters to be assigned them, they having Liberty to transport <hi>Gratis,</hi> including those of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers Nine hundred Horse; and for the Troops remaining behind, to dispose of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as they thought convenient, delivering up their Horse and Arms to such as the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals should nominate to receive them. Horse-Provender for those that were to be Transported, to be bought at the King's Rate, and all Necessaries to be had without mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station. And all those Prisoners of War, on both sides, that were in the Kingdom of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> on the 28th of <hi>September,</hi> to be set at Liberty; the General promising his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:37916:89"/> for the Release of those likewise in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Flanders:</hi> And Medicines and other Necessaries be furnished for the sick and wounded. And that Notice of these things upon signing, be sent to <hi>France,</hi> and those that are to pass thither not to be stopped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Debt, or any other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: And that <hi>French</hi> Ships for Transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation shall freely resort to any Parts, and have Passports; and upon the arrival of such Ships a free Communication shall be between it and the said Troops, more especially for those who have Passes from the Fleet, and Monsieur <hi>de Tumeron</hi> the Intendant; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of which the Town of <hi>Lymerick</hi> was to be put into the Hands of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or whom he shall appoint; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Irish</hi> Town, except the Magazine and Hospital, upon the Day of signing: But the <hi>English</hi> Town, with the Island and free Passage to <hi>Thomond</hi>-Bridge, to be in the Hands of the <hi>Irish</hi> Garrison, or those that shall come from <hi>Clare, Cork, Kerry, &amp;c.</hi> till a Conveniency offer to Transport them. And that no Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders might happen between the Garrisons, the <hi>Irish</hi> Troopers were to remain in the <hi>English</hi> Town and Island, until they should Embarque on the Fifty ships that should first go to <hi>France,</hi> and to keep from any Injury on either side, under pain of Punishment. And when they are to march, they may march out together, or at sundry times, as opportunity of Embarking requires, with Arms, Baggage, Beat or Drum, Lighted
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:37916:89"/> Match, Bullet in Mouth, Colours flying, Six Brass Guns and Two Mortars, with some Ammunition and other Stores, and that an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory, of the Ammunition shall be given to that end, the Day after the signing.</p>
            <p>The Magazines and Provisions to remain in the Hands of those appointed for their care, for the subsistance of the <hi>Irish</hi> that are to pass for <hi>France,</hi> and they to be further fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, if occasion required. And a Cessati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Arms at Land and Sea to be had, in respect to the Ships, either <hi>English, Dutch</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> to be used in the Transportation, until they are returned to their Harbours; and that sufficient Passports shall be on both sides as to Ships and Men; and that any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Cessation shall be punished, and Satisfaction made for the wrong; and that Persons should be sent to give the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Ships notice of this Cessation of Arms for the time; and Hostages be given on both sides: And if there happen any Change in the Government, or Command of the Army, before the Capitulation be fully Executed, it shall yet stand in force.</p>
            <p>This being briefly the Heads and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of these famous Articles, I shall now proceed to what ensued upon so happy a Juncture, in which the Nation had so great a Promise of Peace and Tranquility, which has since raised its drooping Head from the Dust.</p>
            <pb n="168" facs="tcp:37916:90"/>
            <p>About the time of this Agreement, News came that divers <hi>French</hi> Men of War, with Transport-Ships, were on the Coast, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to put into some places, though very distant from <hi>Lymerick;</hi> but either not well knowing the Harbours, or being fearful, as having no certainty of what had happened, they continued cruizing, being seen sometimes off one place, and at other times off another, as being doubtful and uncertain of their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing any thing to the end for which they came; as perhaps, having intelligence that a Squadron of our Men of War, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Sir <hi>Ralph Delaval,</hi> was making to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Ireland,</hi> to prevent any evil design they might have, notwithstanding the Capitulation, considering on our part, that the <hi>French</hi> Maxim is much the same with that of the <hi>Ottomon Port, viz,</hi> To consider nothing against their Interest; but in the firmest Peace to take all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of open Hostility, where any thing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers that may render their Attempts successful. But whether they sooner or latter had an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what had happened at <hi>Lymerick,</hi> and that with the rendering up that important place, all their Measures had been broken, considering in those Articles, the few places of no considerable strength were included, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine not; but certainly so it happened, they attempted nothing worthy of note on the Coast of that Kingdom, but kept out at Sea as well as they could.</p>
            <pb n="169" facs="tcp:37916:90"/>
            <p>During the cruizing of the <hi>French,</hi> we had at length certain knowledge that they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what had happened, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Lymerick</hi> had submitted, and with it all those Places that yet held out, if in the time limited, they, by Surrendring, took the benefit of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles agreed on, which occasioned a greater Security in them, as to the fear of being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by our Men of War; because in one of the Articles it was agreed, that such of the <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>French</hi> as had a mind to leave the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and go for <hi>France,</hi> might stay to expect a free Passage thither, without interruption, and then they more boldly appeared upon the Coast of <hi>Kerry,</hi> being discerned from the Hills and Cliffs, to be about 25 Sail of Men of War, with some Fire-ships, and 25 Transport-ships, and that it might be taken, that their design in coming at first, was no other than to carry off the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> that were unwilling to stay, Monsieur <hi>D'Ʋsson,</hi> the late <hi>French</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, took his first opportunity to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their being there to Major-General <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mash,</hi> who had been appointed by the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to Command at <hi>Lymerick;</hi> and upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation, it being thought more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to suffer such as would transport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in <hi>French</hi> Ships, than trust any of ours in the Enemies Port on that Account, at last it was agreed, that the Transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships might come into the River <hi>Shannon;</hi> but the Men of War and Fireships to keep out at Sea; and that those Transport-ships
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:37916:91"/> should have liberty to take on Board such as would freely imbark.</p>
            <p>In the mean while divers <hi>Irish</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Persons of Quality, who it was by some supposed, would have embraced this voluntary Exile; considering, perhaps, how the <hi>French</hi> had insulted them in their own Country, and expecting worse Treatment when they should be more absolutely under their Jurisdiction, resolved not to trust their kindness by leaving their Native Country, but rather chose to rely upon the kindness of a Generous Prince, whose Word in all things is inviolate, and thereupon spontaniously came in, and took the Oath of Fidelity to their Majesties: Nor were the Rapparees, who are accounted the most obstinate of the <hi>Irish,</hi> behind hand in this: For divers of their Chiefs considering their Safety depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a speedy Submission, thought it their best way to lay hold of the Grace offered, least such a favourable opportunity might for ever be out of their power; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon resolving to lay hold on it, laid down their Arms, and submitted to Mercy, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing many others of their Subalternates to do the like, and bring in their Arms; insomuch that Roads that a little before lay unfrequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Travellers for fear of this rapacious sort of People, were again frequented, and those that had been so terrible to them, now proved their Guards in many places, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:37916:91"/> them against such as yet held out, by which means the face of things seemed won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully changed, and a Country that a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before had been so bloody a Scene of War, now promised, and gave a large prospect of a durable Peace, attended with Plenty, and a greater Advancement by Trade than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in consideration of a greater assurance of Security given, especially to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, by the glorious Success of their Majesties Arms, than has been in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Reigns.</p>
            <p>Although <hi>Sarsfield, Sheldon,</hi> and others, who centered their Fortunes and Interest in the late King, who had mainly raised them by his Favours, expected to draw after the greater part of the Disciplined Soldiers to be disposed of in the Service of the <hi>French</hi> King, as also some of the Gentry and Nobility; yet they missed of their aim.</p>
            <p>Matters being thus brought to a Conclusion in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> care was taken to put our Troops into Winter Quarters, who by such extraordinary Enterprizes so swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly succeeding each other, were somewhat harassed, and required for the recovery of their Strength and Health, more Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Ease than the Field could any ways afford them.</p>
            <pb n="172" facs="tcp:37916:92"/>
            <p>And in this such order and care was taken, that none should be endamaged in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but if any such thing happened by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Oppression or Unruliness of the Officers or Soldiers, the Party grieved, upon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to those appointed to inspect and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late these Affairs, should have speedy redress.</p>
            <p>That the fears of the Countries about <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick,</hi> might be at an end, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> that resolved for <hi>France,</hi> were furthered by the <hi>English,</hi> by way of Friendly assistance for their Embarkment on such Ships as were ordered or allowed to carry them to their desired Ports.</p>
            <p>The Lords Justices received an Account on the first of <hi>November,</hi> from Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Talmash,</hi> That the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> marched out of the <hi>English</hi> Town on the first of the said Month, and part of them em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked on the <hi>French</hi> Ships that were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

            <p>The General, after the many glorious Successes that Crowned their Majesties Arms under his Command in so short a time, arriving at <hi>Dublin,</hi> was received several Miles from that City, by a great Body of the Gentry on Horseback; and approaching through the loud Shouts and Acclamations of the crouding People, was received at the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:37916:92"/> Gates by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen in their Formalities, and highly welcomed, and the Ceremony performed upon the occasion of his coming to that Capital City, ended with a general Joy, and the highest Marks of Respect to a Person who had been so ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>His Majesties Birth-day and the Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary of the Powder-Plot, were likewise ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served with all imaginable Demonstrations of Loyalty, and Marks of Firmness to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion.</p>
            <p>Nor were some of the Papists wanting to express their Satisfaction to see the Hero, who had been so mainly Instrumental in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing them that Peace they had so rashly forfeited; and had leisure during almost a three Years, to repent of the trouble they had given the Kingdom, and of the Losses them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves sustained.</p>
            <p>Whilst this Joy lasted, care was taken to order the Garrisons, and provide them with such Necessaries where they were wanting, as might serve for the Winter Stores, and put the Soldiers in a good plight. Nor was the Joy for these Successes bounded in this Island, but spread into remote Countries; so that in the Camps of the Allies the Cannon was fired, and all other Demonstrations of a high satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the Success of their Majesties Arms were set on foot: though the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:37916:93"/> Commanders, especially in their Camps, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to extenuate these brave and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Undertakings, crowned with such am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Success, least it could dishearten and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the Courage of their Men, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by their frequent deserting, seemed to grow weary of a War, wherein they too plainly found, that instead of what they formerly gained by Plundering, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defenceless Places waste, they must expect nothing but Blows, and severe Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>On the First of <hi>November</hi> following these Transactions, the <hi>Irish</hi> Entirely left the <hi>English</hi> Town of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> Embarking on the Transport-ships in the <hi>Shannon;</hi> when Sailing for <hi>France,</hi> one of those Ships ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on Board Four hundred Men, besides Stores and Furnitures of divers kinds, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning foul on a Rock overset, and about One hundred Men were drowned, though no diligence was wanting to endeavour their preservation.</p>
            <p>Upon the marching out of the <hi>Irish,</hi> our Soldiers marched in, and Garrisoned the <hi>English</hi> Town, and now Sir <hi>David Collier</hi> was made Governour of the City of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick,</hi> and the Lord <hi>O Brian</hi> of the County of the said City. And on the Sixth of this Month the <hi>French</hi> Squadron, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of Eighteen Men of War, Six Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:37916:93"/> and Twenty Transport-ships, who brought about Ten thousand Arms, Wine and Brandy for Sale, and much Provision, fell down about Two Leagues below <hi>Scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, viz.</hi> the Men of War, but their Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port-ships were suffered to remain nearer, to take in Provisions and other Necessaries for Transportation of the People they were to take on Board. And Major-General <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mash</hi> having settled and ordered things to the best Advantage in the City, gave place to the new Governour, and departed for <hi>Dublin,</hi> where he was received with many Expressions of Joy, according to the true merit of his Courage and Conduct in this War.</p>
            <p>Upon this great turn of Fortune, many of their Ringleaders going away in the <hi>French</hi> Ships, the Rapparees found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves abandoned, and in great Distress, so that they were constrained to come in and submit; so that the face of things appeared to be strangely changed, Uproar and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion being turned into a calm Peace; so that most of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> prepared to Embark for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where they soon after Arrived, and passed for <hi>Flanders,</hi> where they were for the Winter Season quartered advantagiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in divers Towns, to hinder the Incursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="176" facs="tcp:37916:94"/>
            <p>The General having put an end to the War of <hi>Ireland,</hi> being highly caressed and treated in <hi>Dublin,</hi> Embarked for <hi>England</hi> on the <hi>Monmouth</hi> Yatch, where he received the Applause and high Commendations of the People in all places where he passed. The King received him very graciously, and Created him Earl of <hi>Athlone, &amp;c.</hi> The Parliament likewise sent their Thanks to him for the good Service he had done, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring him to Communicate the same to all the Officers that had served under him in this Expedition: And he, together with them, was highly Entertained at a Noble Treat by the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Soldiers now returning, a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was Issued forth for their well abear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and behaving themselves in their March, Quarters, and making due Payment. And so great was the Joy of the <hi>Irish</hi> Nobility and Gentry for restoring that Kingdom to Peace and Tranquility, that in humble Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude they made the following Address to his Majesty, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>WE Your Majesties most Dutiful and Loyal Subjects, crave leave in the first place to offer our most humble Thanks to the Divine Majesty, by whom you Reign, for having Raised and Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your Majesty for the Deliverance of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:37916:94"/> these Oppressed Nations, and for preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Your Royal Person, so frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to danger, but never in greater than in the Kingdom and Cause of the Protestants in <hi>IRELAND:</hi> What was then so graciously undertaken by Your Majesty in Person, is now so happily fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by the Success of Your Arms, that we owe to Your Majesty's Courage and Conduct, next to the Divine Providence, the Restoration of our Religion and Civil Rights and Liberties.</p>
               <p>We beseech Your Majesty to Accept this Recognition as the first Fruits of our Redemption, till we are able to make a more Solemn and Parliamentary Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment to Your Majesties Just Title to our Allegiance, not only in Right of this Crown, but in Gratitude to our great Deliverer and Conqueror of Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's Enemies. We are sure Your Majesty will effectually preserve those You have so generously Delivered; and we hope Your Majesty shall never have occasion to doubt the steady and united Affections of the Protestants of <hi>IRELAND</hi> in the Service of your Crown and Dignity, from Principles of Inclination, Duty and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:37916:95"/> Interest; all which makes us unanimous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and heartily to pray for the Sacred Person, Victorious Arms, and Just and Gentle Government of King <hi>WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM</hi> and Queen <hi>MARY,</hi> with Peace and Continuance over us.</p>
            </q>
            <p>On the Two and twentieth of <hi>December, Sarsfield</hi> having got together Two thousand six hundred Men, Women and Children, set Sail from <hi>Cork</hi> for <hi>France:</hi> he thought to have carried a greater Number, but was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by their Deserting him; as did the whole Regiments of <hi>Mac Dermo, Brian O Neal,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Felix O Neal,</hi> upon the Advice they received of the ill Treatment of the <hi>Irish</hi> that were already Landed in <hi>France,</hi> where the Officers were generally displaced, or made to serve in lower Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even to Common Soldiers, and <hi>French</hi> Men set over them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ireland</hi> being now in a fair way to a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, Colonel <hi>Foulk,</hi> Governour of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> had Orders to Disband the <hi>Irish</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that came over to us upon the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> except Fourteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred which were appointed for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's Service; the which, though they professed a great willingness to serve their Majesties, they submitted to, and had Two Cobs a Man given them <hi>Gratis,</hi> most of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:37916:95"/> them going to their Habitations or Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>On the Three and twentieth of <hi>January,</hi> being the first day of the Term, the Right Honourable Sir <hi>Charles Porter,</hi> Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, and <hi>Thomas Conningsby</hi> Esquire, Lords Justices of the Kingdom, came to the Court of <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> accompanied by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Privy Council, and other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Quality; where they took the Oaths, and Subscribed the Declaration required by the late Act of Parliament made in <hi>England:</hi> After which the Judges of other Courts, and Persons of different Quality and Employments did the like.</p>
            <p>About this time there happened an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Storm, which did much Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage at Land, but more by Sea: The <hi>Adventure of London</hi> was cast away on the Coast, and all her Men drowned. A Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel laden with Corn was driven from her Anchor in the Road, and beaten to pieces, but her Men saved, and divers other Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks were driven on shoar in the Ports of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And now the Poor being very numerous, by reason of Losses in the War, care was ordered every where to be taken of them till they could better provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, having convenient Houses appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:37916:96"/> for their shelter. And the Militia of the Country was reviewed, to know in what Condition it stood. And the Lords Justices issued out a Declaration, Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any Officer, Clark, or other Person or Persons whatsoever, depending upon their Majesties Treasury, either by himself or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, to use in part, or in whole, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or indirectly, to buy any Arrears or Debenture due to any Officer, Soldier, or any Person or Persons that have been Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in their Majesties Service the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding War, upon pain of forfeiting the benefit of every Contract or Agreement for such Arrears which shall be paid to the Party to whom they are due, when the same shall come to be paid; as also upon communication of such a Fault, be dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from his or their Employment, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared being uncapable of serving in the Treasury for the future.</p>
            <p>This saved a great many Officers and Soldiers much Money, who to supply pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant need, would have taken a small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for what was after paid them to the full. And now though it had been stipulated and agreed by several Articles made with the Garrison of <hi>Lymerick, Galloway, &amp;c.</hi> That all Arms were to be delivered up, unless such of the Nobility and Gentry as were allowed them for Defence of their Houses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="181" facs="tcp:37916:96"/>
            <p>And this not being punctually observed, a Proclamation was issued out by the Lords Justices, to command all Persons who had any to Surrender, or cause to be Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to the Sheriff of the City, Town, or County, or to the next Justice of the Peace, all their Fire-Arms, Swords, Pikes, Half-Pikes, Halbards, Partisans, Skenns, Bayonets, and all other Arms, Offensive and Defensive. And upon failure or contempt, to be prosecuted to the utmost Severity of the Law: a Reward of Ten shillings was likewise proposed to any Person who should, after the Tenth of <hi>March,</hi> discover any Arms; and the Concealer to be prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the next Assizes as a Contemner of their Majesties Royal Authority, to be looked upon as Disturbers of the Peace, and to forfeit the Benefit of the said Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
            <p>This made a great many of the Papists bring in their Arms, for fear of a Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, which they had kept till now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to so sinister an end: so that by this means the Peace being better assured, the Protestants found themselves out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; the Husbandmen manured their Ground with cheerfulness, as not doubting to reap the benefit of their Labours, which they had been long debarr'd, to the undoing of many Thousands. The Artificers fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to their respective Crafts with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:37916:97"/> So that the Land casting off its bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy stain, laboured to forget its sorrow; and though the usual Trade with <hi>France</hi> was prohibited, yet from <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> all Necessaries were brought that usually supplied the Kingdom from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. And that they might yet be more easie, some illegal Proceedings being represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Lords Justices, they put forth a Proclamation for suppressing them, running to this Tennor; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>THAT the Lords Justices being informed that several Justices of the Peace, Sheriffs, and other Magistrates, presuming on their Power in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, have by colour of their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in a most Illegal and Arbitrary Manner, contrary to the known Laws of the Kingdom, dispossessed several of Their Majesties Subjects, not only of ther Goods and Chattels, but of their Lands and Tenements; They therefore Command and Require all Justices of the Peace, Mayors, Sheriffs, and other Magistrates, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear such Illegal Proceedings, and not to Intermeddle with the Right, Property, Title, or Possession of the Estates, Goods, or Chattels of any of Their Majesties Subjects, other than by due Course of Law
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:37916:97"/> they are required, and as they shall be able to justifie.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This was thrice proclaimed in all the Market-Towns that every one might take notice of it, and have Redress of their Grievances, if any should afterward be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon them, or their Possessions; yet it extented not to the prohibiting the search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, and taking away of Arms.</p>
            <p>And the better to Confirm and Inform all sorts of People, being Dutiful and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, in their Majesties good Intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, their Majesties Proclamation was published in the following words, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>And to the end that none of the <hi>Irish</hi> might be ignorant of what was intended for the good of the Nation, another Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was published in all the chief Towns of the Kingdom, To Ascertain a Day to those that should be distinguished to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended within the Articles of <hi>Lymerick, &amp;c.</hi> To shew their said Rights and Claims to the said Articles; the Lands and other Matters they desire Restitution of, with the Place of their Being and Situation; and that they should have fair Hearings and favourable Constructions made on their Claims and Petitions: The Days and Places of Hearing to that purpose be set and appointed, that none might pretend any mistake on that account, not to come provided with suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Proof and Testimony of such their Rights and Claims, according to the Tennor of the Articles of <hi>Lymerick</hi> and <hi>Galloway, &amp;c.</hi> And that seeing several Protestants did inhabit <hi>Galloway</hi> and <hi>Lymerick,</hi> during the Sieges of those Places, it was required that three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses should give Testimony as to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses, one of them to be a Protestant, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular matter for proof of each Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons qualification, as to the Articles, who claims to have been within the said City or Town, and thereby to be comprised within the said Articles, or either of them.</p>
            <p>And on the Sixth of <hi>April</hi> the Lord's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices of the Council and Kingdom sat to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:37916:99"/> hear and examine the Claims exhibited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, by such Persons as made their Application to them, sitting <hi>Munday, Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesday</hi> and <hi>Friday</hi> weekly for that purpose. And that nothing might be wanting to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and promote the Trade of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Ships daily arrived in the Ports with Provision and other Necessaries, insomuch, that after a long Scarcity, Plenty began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to be restored to a prospect of a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er height than ever, by which the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Sufferings appeared to vanish, and the Joy of the People, the Protestants especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to be restored more than ever, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the Conduct and Government of Affairs of those prudent Persons that are put into Power and Trust.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> thus settled, and in a fair way to Happiness, his Majesty was in <hi>Flanders,</hi> drawing his Forces together to prosecute his Victories on that side, and compleat the Felicity of his Kingdoms, when in the mean while some ill Men of restless Spirits at home, were labouring under hand to disquiet us by endeavouring to hold Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with the Common Enemy, and Encouraging him to invade their Native Kingdoms; but Providence, as at all times, so now more particularly, timely discovered their dark Projects and sinister Designs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon many were apprehended and imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in divers places, in order to be brought to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:37916:99"/> Justice and Condign Punishment; yet this did not so much discourage the <hi>French</hi> King, but that he got his Fleet very early in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness, as it is generally supposed to Invade <hi>England;</hi> but the Winds appeared to stand on our side, and kept them in their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, contrary to their Expectations, though he had drawn down his Forces on the Coast of <hi>Normandy, &amp;c.</hi> to Embark on his Men of War and Transport-ships, as occasion should offer.</p>
            <p>Our Fleet in the mean while was hastned out to oppose them, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons with much Celerity joyned us, so that on the 19th of <hi>May</hi> they stood away to the South-west in search of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, and about six Leagues from <hi>Cape Barfleur</hi> got sight of them, who with much presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bore down upon us, having the Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, the Wind at South-west; and about Eleven in the Morning they Engaged Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Russel,</hi> who commanded our Red Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron. The fight continued hot on both sides till about Three in the Afternoon, <hi>Turville</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Admiral being very much worsted, and fearing to be hemmed in by our Blue Squadron; and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who laboured to get the Wind of the Enemy, bore away, but not so speedily but that the Blew Squadron had time enough to come in and Engage him about Six, so that another hot Dispute continued till about Ten at night, the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:37916:100"/> making a Retreating fight, in which some of their Ships were blown up, and others sunk: All Night it was very calm, and fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy the next Morning; and about Eight it began to clear up, the Wind at East-North-East, when the <hi>French</hi> Fleet appeared about Two Leagues to the Leeward of ours, much less in number than the day before, being but Thirty six Men of War, standing away to their own Coast, whilst ours pursued them; and both Fleets, upon a great Calm, came to an Anchor, the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who now had the Van, being within a League of them; and on the One and twentieth they weighed and stood away, and we after them, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Russel</hi> taking his Course towards <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleur,</hi> having fight of several Ships under the shoar; but by this time many of them were got into the first Harbours they came to; so that fear and too much haste, caused several of them to run aground to prevent our Coming up with them. But it availed lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, for Vice-Admiral <hi>Delaval</hi> hotly pursuing Fliers who put in, made, under <hi>Cape de Wick,</hi> their Squadrons, being now broken and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, with much difficulty got in with light Frigats, Fire-ships, and Armed-Boats, and in spight of the Fire the <hi>French</hi> made from their Ships, and from their Platform on shoar. Captain <hi>Heath</hi> laid the <hi>Royal Sun</hi> of <hi>France</hi> on Board with his Fireship, and burnt her, being the <hi>French</hi> Admiral of 104 Guns; and Captain <hi>Green</hi> burnt the Conquerdant, of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:37916:100"/> 102 Guns; and another Ship of 80 Guns was burnt by the Boats that were sent out after the Men were taken from it, and some other Vessels, with little loss of Men on our side.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Fowlis</hi> attempted to burn the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sun,</hi> but was set on fire by an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental shot from the Enemy, supposed to be made red hot for that purpose. Monsieur <hi>Gaberet</hi>'s Ship, Admiral of the <hi>French</hi> Blew Squadron, perished in the fight amongst the rest.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were doing, Admiral <hi>Russel,</hi> with the Red Squadron, stood with the Enemies Ships, who were got into the Bay of <hi>La Hogue,</hi> and sent Vice-Admiral <hi>Rook,</hi> with a Squadron of Light Frigats and Fireships, and all the Boats he had with him, well arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to burn the Ships he had there penn'd up; which succeeded so well, that Six were burnt that Night, and with the same Resolution Six more were burnt the next Morning, Three of them being Three-deck'd Ships, carrying a great Force of Men and Guns, and the other Three from sixty to seventy Guns: and one of Fifty six Guns was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, and utterly lost: So that the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in that Bay was destroyed; the Men in the Boats on this occasion behaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with much Bravery and Resolution, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that they took possession of several
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:37916:101"/> of the <hi>French</hi> Ships, and turned the Guns upon the Platform that fired upon them from the Land, in the sight of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Camp that lay near the shoar. Many of the <hi>French</hi> Seamen perished with their Ships, those on shoar refusing to fetch them off; and a great many were taken Prisoners. So that in the main we destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about One and twenty of their big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest Ships, and of other Frigats, Crafts, and Transport-ships, to the number of Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and this without the loss of any Ship on our side, unless Fireships that were spent on the Enemy.</p>
            <p>For this Signal Victory the Admiral cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a Solemn Thanksgiving to Almighty God to be held on Board the Fleet; and had the Wind been more timely favourably, few of the <hi>French</hi> that engaged had escaped. This happy News caused great Rejoycing in all their Majesties Dominions, and in the Courts of the Confederate Princes.</p>
            <p>And now to shew God's more signal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Mercy towards us, a Hellish Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy was discovered, that had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on to destroy his Majesty beyond the Seas by Assassination, influenced by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Persons in the <hi>French</hi> Court, to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Infamy, as it was deposed upon Oath; and this was undertaken by one <hi>de Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual,</hi> a Captain of Dragoons in the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:37916:101"/> Service, and one <hi>Dumot</hi> a <hi>Walloon,</hi> who had the last Year agreed together to kill the King; and for that purpose went to <hi>Loo,</hi> whilst his Majesty was there, but missing of their wicked purpose, they went back to <hi>Paris,</hi> and there remaining during the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they engaged one <hi>Leefdale</hi> in the same pernicious Design, agreeing to Attack the King, either upon a March, or when he should ride out to see the Troops; but an Almighty Hand held them from their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting what they so wickedly intended, and saved his Anointed to be a Joy and Comfort to his People, and a Scourge to the Common Enemy, who, though good at close Villanies, and purchasing of Towns, yet not to stand in Competition at fair Valour and Heroick Bravery, as has all along appeared by Retreats and strong En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campments, when urged to Battel in a fair Field; yet, no doubt, a short time will let us see the difference between true Manhood and Politick Delays and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ireland</hi> is now waiting to Receive her Right Honourable Lord Deputy with all the Demonstrations of Joy that a willing Nation can express, sutable to the great Expectations she has to be yet more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py under the Auspicious Conduct of so worthy a Hero, and wise Dispencer of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and an Encourager and Propagator of the Protestant Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The King, by divers Marches and Encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, endeavouring to draw the <hi>French</hi> to a Battel, possessed himself of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> in sight of their main Camp, commanded by the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for all that, they would not stir, only moving a little to alter the front of their Camp; the King caused the Walls to be undermined, that so when he saw cause to move his Camp from it, the Works might be demolished as a place not tenable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst so great an Army as the Enemy had near it; and on the 23d. of <hi>August</hi> the King gave Orders for demolishing the Walls, and several Squadrons of Horse and Battalions of Foot, were posted between our Army and the Town, to secure the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of the Garrison; and about two Hours after, his Majesty marched with the whole Army towards that Place, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our Men, in case the Enemy, who lay on the other side of the Town, should offer to give them any disturbance; and then the Mines were sprung, and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in the Town burnt, and the Garrison was withdrawn in the view of the Enemy, who chose rather to suffer the Affront of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37916:115"/> having one of their Garrisons demolished in the Face of their whole Army, than to stir out of their Camp, or make the least motion to hinder us, least it might engage them in a Fight.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> making a fresh Attempt upon <hi>Montmelian,</hi> took the Town with the loss of 400 Men; but were obliged to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uit it again, as being beat out with the Cannon of the Castle, of which they in vain laboured to make themselves Masters, and only contented themselves with block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it up, which lasted not long neither, before it was entirely relieved, upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Confederate Troops; yet another Party upon the side of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> made themselves Masters with some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of <hi>Pfortzheim,</hi> and made the 200 Men they found in Garrison, Prisoners of War, but upon the approach of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> they abandoned it again, and so it fell into our Hands. And now the <hi>French</hi> were the more disheartened, because they received notice that their dear Ally the <hi>Turk,</hi> was utterly routed in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> by Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden,</hi> and briefly in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince being within fight of the Grand Visir's Camp, the greatest part of the Enemies Horse came out to attack the Right Wing of the Imperialists, which they put into disorder, and defeated an Imperial Battalion, who were all cut off with their Officers, on the place where they were
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37916:115"/> posted: the <hi>Turks</hi> after this, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to fall upon the Foot of our first Line in their Rear, but were prevented and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed, so that in the beginning the success of the Battel was very doubtful: But the Prince recovered this disadvantage by his gallant and prudent Conduct, in causing the Second Line of the Right Wing to advance, and ordering the Left to attack the Enemies Camp at the same time, which they had very well fortified; and this had such Success, that the Enemy was entirely routed, losing 10 Pieces of Cannon, with all their Baggage and Ammunition, and between 20 and 23000 of them killed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Place, and in the pursuit; and the <hi>Germans</hi> lost 3 or 4000 in the Fight, of which number were several Officers of Note.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> upon these bad Successes, betook themselves to Stratagems but as successless; for divers Persons brib'd their Commander to blow up our Bombs and Ammunition-Waggons, by privately put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting lighted Matches among the Bombs and Barrels of Powder, it was so timely prevented, that only 2 or 3 of the Bombs went off, and a Person suspected being charged with the Treachery, confessed, that he had just before been in the <hi>French</hi> Camp, and was hired to do it by the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> and thereupon was sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to have his Right hand cut off, then half Strangled, and so to be Burnt;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37916:116"/> and the Sentence was accordingly put in Execution.</p>
            <p>And now again, as at all other times, Providence had a signal Hand in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of his Majesty's precious Life; for as he stood under a Tree to view the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Camp, and they believing by his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, it could be no other than the King, levelled a piece of Cannon, so that he had not step'd from that Place above a Minute, before a Bullet came and split the Tree in that place he had stood against under it.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>August</hi> the <hi>French</hi> surprized the little Town of <hi>Gers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,</hi> in which was 300 Men. But Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Palfi,</hi> who was abroad with 500 <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars,</hi> routed divers of their stragling Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, killed some, and took a great many Prisoners, recovering a considerable Booty which they had got in ravaging the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>On the 17th. of <hi>September,</hi> our Army in <hi>Flanders</hi> marched from <hi>Irkonwell,</hi> near <hi>Aeth,</hi> to <hi>Leuze,</hi> and decamping again on the 20th. marched to <hi>Cambron.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> who was re-inforced with 4000 Horse, commanded by the Marquis <hi>de Villars,</hi> having notice of that, parted from his Camp with 4 Squadrons of Horse and Dragoons, among which were the Troops of the Houshold, to fall upon our Rear. There happened to be a great Fog that Morning, which was the reason his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37916:116"/> March was not discovered; about Noon our Army had passed the River and <hi>Defile,</hi> near <hi>Catoize,</hi> except some Squadrons and Battalions who had the Rear-Guard. They were charged by the Enemy, and some of our Squadrons were at first put into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, but being supported by the Foot, who had lined the Hedges, and planted 3 small Field Pieces, which did very good Service; they maintained their Post till they were re-inforced by some of the Troops that had already passed the <hi>Defile,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a sharp Dispute, repulsed the Enemy, who retired in Confusion; our Army stood in Battalia till 4 in the Afternoon, when Prince <hi>Waldeck</hi> caused the Rear-Guard to pass the <hi>Defile,</hi> and that Evening encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, at <hi>Cambron,</hi> as the Enemy did in the Plain of <hi>Roucourt:</hi> so that in this Action our Loss was accounted 500, and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies far greater; some Prisoners were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on both sides, and amongst those of the <hi>French,</hi> a Major <hi>du Corps:</hi> we lost 6 or 7 Standards, and took 5 of the Enemies, which belonged to the 2 Troops of the Guard <hi>du Corps,</hi> of which, the Marshal <hi>de Lorge</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Nouailles</hi> were Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. On our side, the young Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> Cornet in the Guards of <hi>Frizeland,</hi> Count <hi>Benthem,</hi> and the Sieur <hi>Riperda,</hi> Captains of Horse, and Major <hi>Felix,</hi> were killed: the Count <hi>de Lippe,</hi> Count <hi>Tilly,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Diedom,</hi> were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; as also several Officers of lesser note.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37916:117"/> Of the <hi>French,</hi> the Count <hi>de Maulevrier,</hi> Lieutenant-General and Governour of <hi>Tournay:</hi> The Count <hi>de Montbrun,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General and Governour of <hi>Cambray:</hi> The Count <hi>de Torges,</hi> who commanded one of the Troops of the Guards, and the Count <hi>d' Mortagon,</hi> Guidon of the <hi>Gens d' Arms,</hi> were killed: The Sieur <hi>de Pommervil,</hi> Governour of <hi>Dorcay,</hi> and the Sieur <hi>de la Rabeliere,</hi> dangerously wounded; besides divers other Officers, whose Names were wanting in the Account.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> was not in this Action, but ordering the Army to their Winter-Quarters in a good condition, was on his way in order to re-pass the Seas.</p>
            <p>The Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> by the progress of his Arms, brought a Terror on the <hi>French</hi> in so suddainly passing the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and other great Enterprizes. Their Fears began to lessen, upon notice of his Death, who dyed the 22d. of <hi>September,</hi> after some Sickness, at <hi>Tubingen</hi> in the 44th. Year of his Age. The New Elector his Son, immediately thereupon writ to the States-General to acquaint them with it, and to assure them of his Resolution, not only to Cultivate and Improve on his part the Ancient Friendship between his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors and this State, but likewise to contribute all that depends on him for the advancement of the Interest of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, and the Common Cause of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom;</hi> ordering at the same time his Men
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37916:117"/> to quarter near the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to be the earlier in the Field the ensuing Campaign.</p>
            <p>And so ended this Campaign 1691: as to Memorable Transactions, (for in Winter there passes little matter of Action, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the bickering of Parties from near Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons under different Commands) but early in the Spring the Armies were ready, and divers <hi>French</hi> Parties advancing too far, were met with, and cut off, and the rest, by reason of the Scarcity that appeared, suffered very much, a Found of Bread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sometimes sold at 5 So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>About the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> a Party of <hi>Germans</hi> being abroad, met a <hi>French</hi> Party near <hi>Worms,</hi> which they defeated, taking 20 Horses, and divers Prisoners.</p>

               </gap>t so happened that an <hi>English</hi> Gentleman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the late King's Family, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Protestant,</hi> dyed at St. <hi>Germains</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> and before his Death ordering his Servant to bury him in a Field; he accordingly performed it: but the Magistrates having notice of it▪
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37916:118"/> caused the dead Body to be digged up, and afterward dragged on a Sledge in a most barbarous manner, and then exposed to the Fury of the Rabble, who tore it in pieces, and cast the dismembered Body on a Dunghil.</p>
            <p>There being a Treaty on foot between the Emperor and the Duke of <hi>Hanouer,</hi> it was about this time concluded; in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of which, the House of <hi>Lunenburg</hi> was to send 6000 Men into <hi>Hungary,</hi> to War against the <hi>Turks,</hi> and 8000 to act against the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Irish,</hi> that came into <hi>France</hi> after the Treaty of <hi>Limerick</hi> suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring greatly for want of Cloaths and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: upon Complaint to the Grand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vost of <hi>Argentan</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> he caused several of them to be Hanged for Mutineers; which so enraged Teague to see his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations frustrated, that a whole Company fell upon the Provost, and killed divers of his Men, himself hardly escaping by Flight.</p>
            <p>On the 19th. of <hi>May</hi> this Year, Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Russell</hi> gained a Signal Victory over the <hi>French</hi> Fleet at Sea, and destroyed in the Fight, and upon their own Coast, about 26 Sail of their Capital Ships, and amongst others, the <hi>Rising Sun,</hi> of 104 Guns; and none of Note killed on our side but Rear-Admiral <hi>Carter,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Hastings,</hi> which Blow greatly discouraged the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and so weakened them, that they have not been able to hold up their Heads at
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37916:118"/> Sea to any purpose for several Years. And now the <hi>French,</hi> otherways despairing of Success, began again under-hand Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conspiracies against the Life of the King of <hi>England,</hi> which was carryed on at the Instance of the Marquis <hi>de Barbiseux,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King's Secretary of State, by the Sieur <hi>de Grandvall,</hi> a Captain of Dragoons in the King's Service, and one <hi>Dumont</hi> a <hi>Walloon,</hi> &amp;c. who watched all Advantages a considerable time, to Kill his Majesty, as he should ride out to view his Troops; but God in his Mercy prevented the wicked Design, and the guilt of some of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators caused them to reveal it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Grandval</hi> being seized, and tryed by a Court-Marshal, confessed how he was hired to do it, and for his Reward was justly Executed in the Camp.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Landing 2000 Men before <hi>Ongelia,</hi> flung in about 200 Bombs, upon which the Inhabitants quitted it, and the Enemy plundered and set Fire to the Town: but the Inhabitants and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia who had retired towards the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, soon after returned, and fell upon the <hi>French</hi> with that Fury, that caused them to Embark in much disorder, leaving 200 Dead behind them.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> having besieged <hi>Namurr,</hi> opened their Trenches, and attacked the advanced Works towards the <hi>Sambre,</hi> against which they raised 2 Batteries, one of 9, and the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37916:119"/> other of 15 Pieces of Cannon: they also raised a Battery against the Castle, and another against St. <hi>Nicholas-Gate,</hi> where they attacked the <hi>Iron-Gate;</hi> but the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged made a great Fire, as well from the Town as the Castle, and one of their Shot set fire to the Enemies Magazine of Powder, which occasioned a great Consternation among them, and killed and wounded di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Men; yet they attacked a Redoubt from the <hi>Iron-Gate,</hi> but were several times beaten off before they could make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Masters of it; which they scarce were, but the Mines took fire, and blew up the Work, and the <hi>French</hi> in it, that were entered: But whilst the King of <hi>England</hi> was hastening to Relieve it, or Fight the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi>'s Army, that covered at some distance the Besiegers, the Town Capitulated, and surrendered; but the Castle and New Fort held out a great while longer, so that the Enemy lost above 5000 Men in this Siege; yet to Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence this Loss, the Imperialists much about the same time, took <hi>Great Warra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> suffering the Garrison to march out with Bag and Baggage, but no Cannon; and the <hi>French</hi> Soldiers daily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted in great Numbers, and came over to us, and a Party of <hi>Hussars,</hi> 2 Troops, and 100 Dragoons fell upon the Enemies Out-Guards, and killed 50 of them; but advancing farther, they were surrounded by a Body of the Enemies Horse, through
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37916:119"/> whom they fought their way back, and returned to the Camp with the loss of 9 Men, and 7 wounded, yet brought off with them divers Prisoners: and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>de Camp de Bay,</hi> with a small Party of Horse and Dragoons, beat a <hi>French</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy that was going to their Camp, destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about 200 Waggons, taking 200 Horses, and 130 Head of Cattle, killing 50 of their Men, and taking 60 Prisoners: And the Count <hi>de Vehlen</hi> marching from the Camp near <hi>Zulphick</hi> with 100 Horse, defeated a <hi>French</hi> Party, who had Burnt two Villages near <hi>Linnich,</hi> of whom they killed about 60, and took 30 Prisoners, with the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer that commanded them.</p>
            <p>These being the Forerunners of greater Actions, for the King having often urged the Enemy to come to a Battel, and finding it declined by strong Encampments, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Removals, at length attacked them in their Camp at <hi>Enghein,</hi> though the Passage to it was extream difficult; which being performed mostly by the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> was carried on with that Bravery and Courage, that the <hi>French</hi> were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued and beaten from one Post to another, and were just at the point of gaining an Entrance into their Camp, had the advanced Parties been timely succoured; but for want of it, and the Enemy not only bending their Cannon directly on them, and charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them on all sides through the Hedges, they were constrained to retreat with the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37916:120"/> Loss of many Soldiers, and some brave Commanders: but the Enemy had little cause to boast, their whole Army narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly escaping an entire Defeat, their number of Men and Officers of note killed, far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ours. In this Fight the Duke of <hi>Chartres</hi> was wounded in the Neck, the Prince <hi>de Turenne,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de Belfonds,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de Tiladet,</hi> Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the Brigadier <hi>Stoupa,</hi> the Chevalier <hi>de Estrades,</hi> Colonel <hi>Paulier</hi> of the <hi>Swissers,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de Fimarcon,</hi> were Killed: The Chevalier <hi>de Merci,</hi> the Marquis <hi>d' Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> the Count <hi>de Florentine,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de Blanville,</hi> and the Marquis of <hi>Thiange,</hi> dangerously Wounded; divers of them soon after dying of their Wounds: in the <hi>French</hi> Regiment, called the <hi>King's Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> about 40 Officers were killed and wounded. Of the Regiment of <hi>Stoupa</hi> 600 Men were killed: and of this and <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>'s Regiment there remained but 4 Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains alive; and besides these, 10 or 12 of the Old Regiments suffered extreamly: And the <hi>French</hi> themselves acknowledg'd they lost 500 Officers, and 5000 private Soldiers. At the same time the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> marching Victorious into <hi>Dauphin,</hi> greatly alarum'd the <hi>French</hi> Court, for he took <hi>Ambrun,</hi> and <hi>Gulestro,</hi> with divers other Places, and Garrisoned them, and had, no doubt, made a great Progress, had he not unhappily fallen sick of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> which obliged him to draw off his Army, and return to <hi>Turin.</hi>

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Leinster</hi> on the 1st. of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> arriving at <hi>Ostend</hi> with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Forces under his Command, they all Landed the next Day, and Encamped at <hi>Martekerke,</hi> about 4 Miles from that Town, and soon after being joyned by a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the King's Camp, under the Command of Lieutenant-General <hi>Talmash,</hi> they marched towards <hi>Newport,</hi> and 4 Regiments were sent to possess themselves of <hi>Furnes,</hi> which accordingly succeeded, and 2000 Pioneers were ordered to fortifie it; and soon after <hi>Dyxmude</hi> fell into our Hands, with the Villages, and other adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Places; which brought such a Fear
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37916:121"/> upon <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> that they kept close within the Munitions, not daring to stir out to hinder us: and so having Garrisoned those Places, and not finding it practicable to besiege <hi>Dunkirk</hi> with so small an Army, the Fleet returned again to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>September, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benburg</hi> was besieged by the Imperialists, and on the 20th. of that Month, the Castle of <hi>Stauffen</hi> surrendered to them upon discretion, and 70 <hi>French</hi> in Garrison were made Prisoners of War, and the same day the <hi>Germans</hi> put a Garrison into <hi>New Leiningen,</hi> which put the <hi>French</hi> upon their old Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem to draw them off; for the Marquis <hi>de Boufflers</hi> having repass'd the <hi>Meuse</hi> at <hi>Namure,</hi> with 6000 Horse, and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced with several Detachments from <hi>Dinant, Namure</hi> and <hi>Maubege,</hi> marched to <hi>Hainault</hi> and St. <hi>Trone,</hi> and detaching 50 Horse and 50 Foot, who burnt the Little Town of <hi>Bilsem,</hi> and sending out about the same time several other Parties, they Burnt divers other Towns thereabout; but upon the approach of our Troops, retired with great precipitation, insomuch that they quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a considerable part of their Booty; the Margrave of <hi>Bareith,</hi> the Landtgrave of <hi>Hessecassel,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Wirtemburg,</hi> Count <hi>Stirum,</hi> and General <hi>Thungen,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to take their Quarters about <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stadt,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Garrison consisting of 2 or 300 Men, retired upon their approach, and left them Masters of it, without a blow; and

            </p>
            <p>About this time the Troops of <hi>Newburg</hi> and <hi>Cologne</hi> lying near <hi>Malmedy,</hi> sent out a Detachment of 1800 Foot and 2000 Horse, making 12 Squadrons and 3 Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions, with 6 Pieces of Cannon, under the Command of Major-General <hi>Weix,</hi> and the Count de <hi>Velen,</hi> to attack the Marquis <hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> who was with 5 Battalions and 24 Squadrons near <hi>Aldoff;</hi> and our Horse being come within sight of the Enemy, immediately attacked them without stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Foot, and at first forced them to give way; but the <hi>French</hi> making use of their Cannon, it put our Horse into some disorder, and obliged them to retire, whereupon the Count <hi>Velin</hi> with 2 Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, were taken Prisoners, and we lost about 150 Men, though the Enemy was hotly charged, and a great many of them fell in the Battel, not without the loss of some of their Chief Commanders.</p>
            <p>In this Month happened, <hi>viz.</hi> on the 8th.

            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1693.

               </gap> and a Squadron of Men of War, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Rear-Admiral <hi>Mitchel,</hi> where he safely arrived, and was received with great Joy; and the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Governour of <hi>Flanders,</hi> sent the Duke of <hi>Arco</hi> to Complement his Majesty upon his safe arrival in <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to begin this Campaign, 100 <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghers</hi> having notice that 80 <hi>French</hi> were in a Village, called <hi>Malterne,</hi> they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither, and obliged them to yield themselves Prisoners of War; and the Camp for the general Rendezvous of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37916:122"/> Army was marked out, and Works cast about it, near the City of <hi>Brussels.</hi> The Enemy likewise drew out from their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Quarters; the <hi>French</hi> King having created a great many new Officers, and divers Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shals of <hi>France,</hi> amongst whom is Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Tourville,</hi> who was beaten the last Year at Sea by the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch;</hi> which so disgusted several of the Grandees, that they threw up their Commissions of Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-Generals, and retired to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Habitations.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vaudois</hi> being in Arms in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, set upon 200 <hi>French,</hi> who came to cut Wood for the use of the Town of <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerol,</hi> and getting between them and home, fell on with such Fury, that they killed 100, and took 16 Prisoners, with an Officer, with the loss only of 2 Men, and pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Success, they fell in with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy going to that Place, laden with Corn and Meal, and took it almost within Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-shot of the Town; the Enemy, tho' mainly disappointed thereby, not daring to attempt the Relief of it, and the <hi>French</hi> watching for our Merchants passing the <hi>Streights,</hi> one of their Men of War, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Captain <hi>Doudon,</hi> carrying 44 Guns, and 250 Men, set upon the <hi>Berkley Castle,</hi> commanded by Captain <hi>Barret,</hi> at Sun-rising, and continued the Fight till Night; at what time the <hi>French</hi>-man find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had catched a <hi>Tartar,</hi> his Fore-mast and Main-Top-mast being shot down, and his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37916:123"/> Stern tore to pieces, bore away, having 52 Men killed, 35 wounded, and 15 Prisoners ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in attempting to board the <hi>English</hi> Ship.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> this Year having an Army in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> Ravaged and Burnt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Places, as <hi>Frankendale, Spires,</hi> and the famous Town of <hi>Heidleburg,</hi> blowing up the Castle; for the cowardly Surrender of which, the Governour upon his arrival at Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi>'s Camp, was put under Arrest, it appearing that he caused the several Posts to be quitted, before the Enemy had gained one foot of Ground, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that finding the Klingersconce and the Walls deserted, they forced one of the Gates, and entered the Town with little or no opposition; and having destroyed the Place, they deserted it, and retired towards <hi>Philipsburg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the Enemy finding the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces strong in <hi>Flanders,</hi> laboured to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them, by making War in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> where the Duke <hi>de Nouailles,</hi> with much difficulty, took the little Town of <hi>Roses,</hi> and laid Siege to <hi>Huy</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which they, after a stout Resistance, had sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered to them. But in the mean while the Duke of <hi>Wirtemburg</hi> with a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of Horse and Foot, forced the Enemies Lines, and entered <hi>French Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> where he put the Country under Contribution, and raised a Million of Livres, taking divers small Places, and very much Booty.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:37916:123"/>
            <p>But whilst these things happened, our <hi>Straights</hi> and <hi>Turkey</hi> Fleet fell in with the <hi>French</hi> main Fleet, who were upon the Watch for them, near <hi>Lagos-Bay;</hi> yet whilst some of the Men of War, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyed them, disputed it, most of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Ships got into Harbour; and the Men of War finding themselves unable to cope with so great a Number of Ships, made an advantagious Retreat, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving seen most of the Merchant-Men safe in their Harbour.</p>
            <p>But to return to Land again, we there find the two Armies in <hi>Flanders</hi> within a few Hours march of each other, so that many Skirmishes happened between the Out-parties: after which, the Duke of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburg</hi> marched with 50 Squadrons of Horse, and 10 Battalions of Foot, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise some Field-Pieces, to <hi>Tongres,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to fall upon part of the Garrisons of <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Mastritcht,</hi> being 18 Squadrons, and some Foot, who lay near the Place, under the Command of Count <hi>Tilley,</hi> but he having notice of it, retired over the <hi>Sare,</hi> leaving only 3 Squadron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to secure his Retreat: the <hi>French</hi> sent against them the like Number, but they beat them back, yet fresh Troops being sent, our Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated. These were the Forerunners of greater Actions, and were succeeded by the Battel of <hi>Landen,</hi> which was in this manner.</p>
            <p>On the 18th. of the last Month, New
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:37916:124"/> Style, the King being at His Camp at <hi>Park,</hi> understood that the Enemy was marching towards the <hi>Meuse,</hi> whereupon His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty march'd the 21st. to <hi>Tirlemont,</hi> where receiving News that the Enemy had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd <hi>Huy,</hi> we continued our march as far as <hi>Hopertingue,</hi> between St. <hi>Tron</hi> and <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres,</hi> with a design to succour the Place. There His Majesty being informed of the Surrender of <hi>Huy,</hi> detached the same day 10 Battalions to strengthen the Garrison of <hi>Liege,</hi> and so returned the next day to <hi>Neer Hespen,</hi> where the Army halted, that it might not be too far from the Enemy before their Design was known, to which end, several Parties were sent out towards their Camp, which stretch'd it self almost from the River <hi>Jocker</hi> to the <hi>Meuse.</hi> On the 28th. the Parties brought Word, that they could not come so near the <hi>French</hi> Camp as usual, because they found a great Body of Horse upon the High Grounds near the Mill of <hi>Warrem,</hi> which hindered them from making any discovery beyond the <hi>Jocker:</hi> some Hours after the King was acquainted that the Enemy appeared from the high Grounds of St. <hi>Gertruyden-Landen,</hi> at half an hours distance from the Camp, His Majes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y sending out Parties, soon discovered that it was the Van-Guard of their Army that had marched before day without beat of Drum. His Majesty not doubting but they intended to attack our Army, resolved to fight them; to which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:37916:124"/> end, having ordered the Foot to their Arms, and the Troopers to mount, made that Evening the Disposition of his Army, having plac'd the Right Wing towards the Village of <hi>Elixem,</hi> and the Castle of <hi>Loany</hi> upon the River of <hi>Gheete.</hi> The Left of the Right Wing extended it self to the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of <hi>Neerwinden,</hi> being covered by a little Rivolet, some Hedges and Hollow-ways. The Brigade of <hi>Ramsey</hi> consisting of 5 Battalions was plac'd before the Right Wing near <hi>Larre.</hi> The <hi>Brandenburg</hi> Foot over against <hi>Larre,</hi> and that of <hi>Hanouer</hi> over against <hi>Winden.</hi> His Majesty finding the Ground very much open from <hi>Winden,</hi> to <hi>Neerlanden,</hi> caused a Retrenchment to be made in the Night between those places, behind which His Majesty placed the rest of the Foot, and some Battalions in the Village of <hi>Neerlanden.</hi> The Left Wing began towards the Village of <hi>Dormal,</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Rivulet of <hi>Landen,</hi> as far as <hi>Neerlanden,</hi> where it made an Elbow that returned behind the Foot, which was upon the Retrenchments the better to second it.</p>
            <p>Our Army remain'd all Night in this Disposition. At the break of Day we saw the Enemy drawn up in two Lines upon the high Grounds of St. <hi>Gertruyden-Landen,</hi> and another Body that advanced towards our Retrenchment on the side of <hi>Winden.</hi> At Sun-rising the Enemy was advanced so near to us, that we play'd our Cannon
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:37916:125"/> upon them; for about two Hours they made no motion. About six a Clock those that remained on the High Grounds, came down in several Lines, and when they were within reach of our Cannon, they left the middle of the Plain, and caused their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry to File off to our Right, towards the Village of <hi>Winden</hi> and <hi>Larre,</hi> and on our Left towards the Village of <hi>Neerlanden,</hi> being sustain'd by their Horse, which marched on both sides of the Plain, and caus'd a Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> to pass on the other side of the Rivulet of <hi>Landen,</hi> to make us believe they intended to fall upon our Left Wing, while they should make their greatest Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort upon our Left, which they attack'd about seven Hours after.</p>
            <p>The Fight lasted on that side for some Hours with doubtful success; the Enemy advanced, and were repulsed several times, and even some Squadrons got over the little Rivulet below the Village of <hi>Larre,</hi> and came into our Camp, most of which were either killed or taken. In the mean while, the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> behaving himself with the greatest Vigour, and giving Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to all the Right Wing, made them charge so advantagiously, that he made the Enemy give way, and drove them back into the Plain. The Brigade of <hi>Ramsey,</hi> that had been forced to give Ground, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain'd their Posts. The Electoral Prince of <hi>Hanouer</hi> brought up his Infantry again into their Posts, as did the Prince of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:37916:125"/> his own Foot. The <hi>French</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless remained in some part of the Village at <hi>Winden;</hi> but finding that they could not force our Right Wing, attack'd the Village of <hi>Neerlanden</hi> on our Left, where having been beaten back after a very great Fight, they renewed their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack with fresh Troops, which obliged the King to come from the Right to give the necessary Orders at the Left, where the Fight was renewed again very warmly with small Shot, which continued about an Hour, when we became Masters of the Village, having driven the Enemy quite out of it, which made them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw all their Troops from the Attack, where they had succeeded so ill, carrying them to their Left and our Right, where had been always some small Firing; and though the Enemy had been beaten at the Left, they had nevertheless kept a part of the Village of <hi>Winden,</hi> and made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Masters of the Hedges of the rising Ground, which laid the Flank of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment open to them. The King, who was in every place where his Presence could be any ways useful; after having se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured every thing on the Left, returned immediately to the Village of <hi>Winden,</hi> and brought up twice to our Retrenchments the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Foot, where they behaved themselves as they had done every where else, with great Resolution and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> did dispose
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:37916:126"/> two Battalions, so as to take the Enemy in the Left Flank, whilst three others at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd them in the Front; but before this could be put in Execution, the Enemy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been strengthened with such of their Forces as they had drawn from the Right, became Masters of the Passage into the Village, and made an Overture through which their Horse began to pass with the help of their Foot that lay in the Hedges. Their Horse that passed first, were beaten back, but our Foot at the Retrenchment not being able to suffer their Fire any longer in Flank, was obliged to retire, and our Cannon on that side abating its Fire, the Enemies Horse crouded through the Passage, and began to extend themselves towards their Left all along the Hedges, which were possessed by their Foot. Most part of this Cavalry consisted of the <hi>French</hi> King's Houshold.</p>
            <p>As soon as they had formed some Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, they attack'd the Troops of <hi>Hanouer</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> which were on the Left of the Right Wing, and took the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Motion of part of those Troops which they forced to retire, and at the same time went to their Left, and did the like to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Troops which were on the Right of the <hi>Hanouer</hi> Horse. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, to remedy this Disorder, caused part of the Left Wing to advance, but being far off the Enemy, did not give them time to form themselves, but having attack'd the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37916:126"/>
               <hi>Dutch</hi> Horse on the Left, partly in Flank, forced them to retire before the <hi>English</hi> had got into a Line, who were obliged to attack the Enemy as they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which some did with Success, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beaten what came before them; but the Right Wing having been forced to pass the River, the <hi>English</hi> Troops were quite encompassed. The King finding the Enemy over-powered us, sent Orders to the Generals of the Foot, and to those of the Left Wing, to retire to <hi>Leuwe,</hi> a Fort near the Camp. The King's Dragoons and Grenadiers that lined the Rivulet of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> made their Retreat by the River through the Village of <hi>Dormal,</hi> and the Foot and part of Cavalry of the Left Wing by <hi>Orsmel.</hi> The Enemy, whose Horse was drawn up in two Lines upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Ground, adventuring to attack them in their Retreat. The King having given all necessary Orders every where for the Retreat, and finding himself encompassed on all sides, thought fit to go over the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and with great difficulty passed the Bridge that had been made at the Village of <hi>Neerhespen,</hi> where His Majesty met some of His Guards and Light Horse of the Right Wing, and the remainder of the Brigade of <hi>Ramsey:</hi> and near <hi>Tirlemont</hi> came up with those Troops of the Right Wing that had been Rallied by the Elector of <hi>Bavaria.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:37916:127"/>
            <p>In this great and long continued Battel, the Enemy lost about 13000 Men, most of them not only their best Soldiers, but Officers, and many of them Persons of great Quality; the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> was taken Prisoner by our Forces; and the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> after all the Resistance, a brave and valiant Spirit was capable of, fell into the Hands of the Enemy, grievously wounded, but soon after the exchange was made, and both Parties set at Liberty.</p>
            <p>Upon the King's Retreat, the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> with the Forces under his Command, whose absence gave the <hi>French</hi> the boldness to attack our Camp, was immediately sent for, and the Loss we at first supposed we had sustained, was much less than we thought, by the daily coming in of the Troops that retreated by several ways, so that 7 or 8000 Men were the most accounted to be lost on our side: and this great Battel in a manner ended the Campaign in <hi>Flanders;</hi> but on the <hi>Savoy</hi> side a great Fight happened between that Duke and Monsieur <hi>Catinat,</hi> wherein many brave Men were killed on either side, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the <hi>French</hi> Nobility, and on our side the valiant Duke of <hi>Schomberg</hi> fighting couragiously at the Head of his Battalion in the hottest of the Battel; and although the <hi>French</hi> kept the Field, they had only the Name of Victory bought at a very dear rate: And the <hi>French</hi> repassing the Mountains somewhat late in the Season,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37916:127"/> many Thousands of them perished in the Snow, besides a great deal of their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage. And thus we conclude this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign of 1693. as to the memorable Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions that happened, for all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies proposed Attempts afterwards were only Bravado's, and came to little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And the King having disposed things to the best Advantage, returned to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the opening the Campaign, 1694. the Enemy was slower than usual, as having not only lost a great many Men and Horses, as well by Sickness as in the War, but being in extream want of Corn, and all sorts of Provision, there having been an Extraordinary Famine the Year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in which many Thousands dyed. The Confederates had time to draw their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies into the Field, before the Enemy could attempt any thing; and to hasten them the more, and put things into a readiness, his Majesty on the 6th. of <hi>May,</hi> embarked on the <hi>Fubs-Yatch,</hi> attended by 8 <hi>Dutch</hi> Men of War, and sailed for <hi>Holland,</hi> where he was received with the usual Joy, and from thence in a little time, passed to the Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which he found in a great forwardness, and gave necessary Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for its taking the Field; while the Enemy was yet unprepared by disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Forrage, and the emptiness of many of their Magazines upon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers. About this time the Elector of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37916:128"/>
               <hi>Saxony</hi> dyed at <hi>Dresden,</hi> by which the <hi>French</hi> hoped to reap some Advantage, but it proves ineffectual to them; for Prince <hi>Frederick Augustus,</hi> his Brother, succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in that Principality, confirmed to the Confederates all the Elector de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, had agreed to: And the great Master of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order, who stood in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition upon the Difference arising at the Election with Prince <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> for the Bishoprick of <hi>Liege,</hi> dying, the <hi>French</hi> Party laboured at <hi>Rome</hi> to hinder the Confirmation of the latter, but it availed not; for the Pope, to whom it was referred, has since declared in favour of the Prince: which great disappointment nohas weakened the Interest of the Crown of <hi>France</hi> on that side.</p>
            <p>Our Navy-Royal now being abroad, Admiral <hi>Russell</hi> had notice by a <hi>Sweed,</hi> that a great Fleet of <hi>French,</hi> laden with Corn and Naval Stores, were in <hi>Conquet-Bay</hi> on their way to <hi>France,</hi> who sent Captain <hi>Pickard</hi> with another Man of War, and a Fireship, to get an Account of them; but they no sooner appeared within sight, but the <hi>French</hi> cut their Cables, and stood into the Shore, thinking them the forerunners of our Fleet, and for hast, run upon the Shallows and Rocks, and by the Shot from our Men of War, about 50 of them perished, and 2 or 3 of them fell into our Hands.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> main Fleet being gone into the <hi>Straights</hi> to facilitate the Marshal <hi>de
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37916:128"/> Nouailles</hi> Attempt upon <hi>Bracellona,</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Russell,</hi> with the Capital Ships of the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, joyned by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of Men of War, stood away in search of them, provided with Naval Stores and Necessaries suitable to so great an Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: so that upon his approach, the <hi>French</hi> Fleet under <hi>Tourville,</hi> were forced to quit the Enterprize, and get into <hi>Toulon,</hi> laying a Bomb cross the Channel, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Guns on Shore, to fortifie the Places.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Berkly</hi> being upon the Coast of <hi>France,</hi> with a considerable Squadron of Men of War, and on board them Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General <hi>Talmash,</hi> with a considerable Strength of Land-Forces, a Descent was resolved upon; and whilst the Marquis of <hi>Caermarthen</hi> stood into <hi>Cameret-Bay</hi> with 7 Men of War, battering the Forts the Enemy had raised on either Shore; under the favour of his Guns, the Soldiers entered the Boats, and resolutely thrust on Shore, the Lieutenant-General being at the Head of them, charging and killing a great number of the Enemy; but upon advancing, they found the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my entrenched behind strong Works, and very numerous in Horse and Foot, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Expectation; insomuch that it was thought advisable to Retreat, in which the Lieutenant-General was wounded in the Thigh with a Musquet-Bullet, yet brought off his Men with as little Loss
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37916:129"/> as might be; but being carry'd to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> he soon after dyed, by reason of the Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greening of his Wound: though in this Action the Enemy lost a great many of their Men, and some Officers of Note, our Cannon more particularly doing them very considerable Damage, in Ruining their Battery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst these things happened near Home, the <hi>French</hi> made a great Effort in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Villenay,</hi> Viceroy of the Country, having Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that the Enemy was marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Gironne,</hi> he drew together a Body of 11000 Foot, and 4000 Horse, most of them new raised Men, and posted them with 12 Pieces of Cannon to defend the Passage of the River <hi>Ter:</hi> but before they could raise sufficient Works, the Enemy advanced, having received great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcements by Sea, which made their Army 20000 Foot and 8000 Horse, and Charging those that guarded the Pass, made them give way, but were bravely received by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Horse, who Charged divers times, and Killed a great many of the Enemy; but being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbred, they were forced to Retreat in some disorder: And in this Action the <hi>Spaniards</hi> lost about 3000 Men, and the Enemy not a less number; whereupon they proceeded to Besiege the Castle of <hi>Palamos,</hi> which after a stout Resistance, surrendered, the Garrison, consisting of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:37916:129"/> 1400 Men, were made Prisoners of War; but the Governour and some of Note, were permitted to go to <hi>Gironne</hi> upon their Parole: but the whole Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Arms, and the Grandees sending in their Quota's, together with the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments of the Assistance they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from their Fleet, by reason of Admiral <hi>Russell</hi> s coming into those Seas with the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet; they have since done very little on that side, but rather lost abundance of their Men by Sickness and Desertion.</p>
            <p>About the middle of <hi>June,</hi> the Squadron of <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Men of War in the Ocean, commanded by the Lord <hi>Berkly,</hi> attended by divers Bomb-Ketches, came before <hi>Diep,</hi> a very considerable Sea-Port Town, on the Coast of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the Ketches under the favour of the Great Guns from the Men of War, getting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Harbour, supported by divers light Frigats, notwithstanding the continual Fire of the Enemy, played very furiously and successfully into the Town; so that although Monsieur <hi>de Beuron,</hi> Lieutenant of that Province, arrived there the mean while, and caused the Streets to be unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to prevent the greater Mischief by the falling of the Bombs, and other ways, laboured all he could to save the Town, it was set on Fire in several places at once, so that it flamed very terribly for 3 Days, and 2 Magazines were heard to blow
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:37916:130"/> up, and in one of them, by the Blow, was supposed to be between 4 and 500 Barrels of Powder, which set others on fire, and tore a great part of that Quarter of the Town; and it was thought several great Ships were burnt and blown up, by reason of the Guns that were heard to go off at the same time: And in brief, the Town being altogether laid in Ashes, and the <hi>English</hi> having done what they came for, sailed on the 15th. of <hi>July</hi> before <hi>Hauvre de Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 17th. they came before the Place, and found the Shores guarded with Numerous Troops; the Wind blew very hard, but the next Day toward the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Weather was calm, and the Bomb-Vessels warped in as near as they could to the Town, being covered by a great many Boats, Manned with Sea-men and Soldiers. The Enemy fired all the while from their Batteries on the Shore, without doing us any damage. The Night was spent in throwing in about 250 Bombs, and more had been fired, but that the Wind grew very high, which obliged our Vessels to stand off again in the Morning; in the Night several Fires were seen in the Town, and one particularly, which by the great Blaze and long continuance, was supposed to be a Magazine of New Stores; and though the Enemy sunk 6 Ships in the Harbour, to obstruct our nearer approach, yet above a third part of the Town was
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37916:130"/> laid in Ashes, and the rest much shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. The next day the Lord <hi>Berkley</hi> sailed towards <hi>La Hogue</hi> and <hi>Cherbourg,</hi> not only alarming, but bringing a great Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror upon all the Coast.</p>
            <p>Soon after these Successes, an Attempt was made upon <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine filled with Bombs and Carcasses, brought to bear upon their Out-forts and Works, which being blown up on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, rent and shattered some of them in a dreadful manner: but finding the Place strongly fortified by Art and Nature, our Ships drew off before <hi>Calais,</hi> where they had done considerable Execution, had not the Seas run high, and the Shallows and Sands obstructed their near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
            <p>The King having endeavoured by the often removal of his Camp in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to oblige the <hi>French</hi> to a Battel, or to gain upon them, and they endeavouring all they could to shun it; there only happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some Skirmishes between advanced and detached Parties, he caused <hi>Huy</hi> to be Besieged, which, with little resistance, he took, and Garrisoned it with a strong Garrison, still advancing and gaining upon the Enemy, who quitted some of the Lines and Out-works; so that this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer our Quarters are much inlarged in those Countries, by taking in a great many Villages and Important Posts.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:37916:131"/>
            <p>Whilst these things happened on that side, Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> lying with the <hi>German</hi> Army on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and the <hi>Saxon</hi> Troops being come up with him, finding he could not bring the <hi>French</hi> to a Battel, caused Bridges to be laid over the River, and passed over his Foot and Cavalry, before whom the Enemy retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with much Precipitation, and had divers of their Troops cut off in the Rear; several Places of advantage were seized on by the Imperialists, and the <hi>Saxons,</hi> in a kind of separate Body, did the like on their part; so that not only considerable Contributions were raised, but a great Fear and Consternation was brought on the <hi>French</hi> Garrison in <hi>Philipsburg;</hi> but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to oblige the Enemy to Battel, they repassed the River with great Booty. Some Parties of his Majesties Army, being again abroad, one of them brought in 20 <hi>French</hi> Foot, and 14 Troopers: and another brought in 114 Foot, and 48 Troopers with their Horses and Accoutrements; and several others were killed in the Rencounter.</p>
            <p>The Season advancing apace by reason of the Rains, and want of Forrage abroad, little more of moment happened, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy altogether declining any thing that looked like coming to a Battel, so that the King having given necessary Orders for advantagiously posting the Troops in their Winter-Quarters, and every thing else that was convenient to be done, left
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37916:131"/> the Army, and went for <hi>Holland,</hi> in order to his Return for <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To strengthen the Alliance, and hinder the Designs of <hi>France</hi> in the Court of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> a Marriage this Summer was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the <hi>Spanish Netherlands,</hi> and the King of <hi>Poland</hi>'s Daughter.</p>
            <p>The last of <hi>July,</hi> one of our Parties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated a Party near <hi>Charleroy,</hi> of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, killing divers of them, and taking 60 Prisoners, and a Party of the Garrison of <hi>Aeth,</hi> with a Detachment of Horse from the Flying Camp in <hi>Flanders,</hi> forced the <hi>French</hi> Lines between St. <hi>Guislane</hi> and <hi>Conde,</hi> killed several of the Enemy that guarded them, and took the remainder Prisoners: after that, they advanced into the Neighbourhood of <hi>Quinsnoy</hi> and <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciennes,</hi> where they put the Country under Contribution, and brought back with them divers Hostages for performance of the Payment, together with a Booty of 300 Sheep, 200 Cows, and 150 Horses, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party of our Men beat a Party of the <hi>French,</hi> killed some, and took divers Prisoners.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> advancing somewhat near the City of <hi>Liege</hi> in great Parties, the Troops of that place had 2 Rencounters with them, and took between 7 or 800 Horse, and entirely defeated 2 Squadrons of Horse of their Forrage-Guards; and a Party of 16 <hi>Spaniards</hi> brought into the Camp 40 Prisoners and 50 Horse.</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:37916:132"/>
            <p>Their Majesties Ship the <hi>Soldadoes,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Allen</hi> Commander, cruzing off Cape <hi>de Hogue,</hi> in Company of the <hi>Hind-Pink,</hi> met with 6 Sail of <hi>French</hi> Ships, one of them a Frigate of 26 or 30 Guns, three of them Privateers, from 16 Guns down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and the other two Merchant Ships of 180 Tun each: but upon the Fire of our Guns, they stood into <hi>Granton-Bay,</hi> where one of the Merchant-Ships run on Shore about two Miles short of the rest, but she was fetched off and carry'd away by two Privateers of <hi>Guernsey,</hi> whilst the rest engaged the Enemy for 6 or 7 Hours; and having received great Damage by our Shot, they all run on Ground, and left them: whereupon we sent out our Boats to have Burnt them, but the Shore was so lined with Horse and Foot, that it could not be effected.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Talbot-Pink</hi> being on the Coast of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and having Notice that the <hi>Irish</hi> frequently gave Intelligence to the <hi>French</hi> Privateers; to be satisfied therein, came to an Anchor under a Place called <hi>Ireland</hi>'s <hi>Eye;</hi> the Commander putting up <hi>French</hi> Colours, ordered all his Men, in case any appeared from the Shore, to go under Deck, except such as could speak <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Irish:</hi> soon after this, a Boat came off with 4 <hi>Irish</hi> Men, who taking her for a <hi>French</hi> Ship, came on Board, and gave the Commander an Account of several things, and among others, of what Ships there lay in the Bay:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37916:132"/> upon which he caused them to be seized, and sent Prisoners to <hi>Dublin,</hi> in order to be tryed as Betrayers of their Country, by holding Correspondency with the Enemy.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> having sent out several Parties of Horse, to get Intelligence of the Enemies motion: the next Morning he understood that his unexpected March had greatly alarmed them, and that they had decamped about Midnight in great hast, and with so much Precipitation, that they had not time to give the Parties that were in <hi>Bergstraet,</hi> notice to joyn them, warning them only with a Signal of 10 Guns, of the <hi>Germans</hi> approach, leaving several Waggons, Arms, and other things behind them in their Camp, as fearing our Army might get between them and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to cut off their Retreat or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with <hi>Philipsburg:</hi> but the <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars,</hi> suddenly passed the <hi>Neckar,</hi> and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked some of the Enemies Parties, of whom they killed about 60, and took di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Prisoners: and the next Day happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a sharp Rencounter between our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance-Guards, and some of the Enemies Troops who came from <hi>Heidelberg.</hi> The Enemy brought two Battalions of Foot, and a Regiment of Dragoons to force our Men from an Eminency upon the Bridge of a River that passes near <hi>Viseloch,</hi> where they kept their Ground; and being re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by a Detachment from our first Line, beat them back in much disorder;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37916:133"/> and in this Action, the Count <hi>d' Auverna,</hi> Brigadier; and the Marshal <hi>de Beronne,</hi> Colonel of the Dragoons, with about 5 or 6 Captains, and other Officers, also 200 Soldiers were killed, and on our side about 80 were killed, and the Baron <hi>de Merci</hi> Adjutant-General was wounded and taken Prisoner, and soon after 88 <hi>French</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, four of them Officers, were brought into the Camp, and many other Prisoners were taken by our Out-parties, and a great number of Deserters came in.</p>
            <p>The Imperial Army encamping near <hi>Peter Waradin,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> came down upon them, so that the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialists thought it not convenient to move out of their Camp, yet Parties frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged, and the two Fleets upon the <hi>Danube</hi> did the like, Cannonading perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in a manner happening between the two Armies; but our Army being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

About the beginning of this Month our Dey marched into the Territories of the Tuniseens; <hi>Mahomet</hi> Bey came with his Forces to oppose him; and on the 21st. of the last Month the two Armies encamped in sight of each other near <hi>Keff,</hi> which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two days Journey from the City of <hi>Tunis: Mahomet</hi> Bey had with him about 10000 Foot and 20000 Horse; but the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines were not above 12000, both Horse and Foot: There happened the same day a small Skirmish, in which the Tuniseens had the advantage. On the 25th. <hi>Mahomet</hi> Bey drew out his Forces, and offered the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines Battel, but <hi>Shaban</hi> Dey, considering the inequality of their numbers, kept within his Camp, saying, It was not lawful to fight on that Day which was appointed by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet for performing of their Devotions; The Tuniseens thereupon attack'd his Camp, which was strongly intrench'd, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The Tuniseens fled in great Confusion, and had not the Algerines spared them in the pursuit, most of the Foot had been cut off.
